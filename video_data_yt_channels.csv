Cliff notes:
Cliff advises not to rely on his memory for the volume of a sphere.  It's really 4/3 π r^3.   Cliff also says that using a tube to break the vapor lock is challenging.  Straws (even flexo-straws) kink when bent around narrow hairpin curves.  And most flexible tubes (especially aquarium air tubing) have high friction against glass, so they're difficult to thread along the curve.

----------------

As expected many people ask ""what is the point of this""... And fair enough.

Rather than answering everyone individually, here is my view (I am just the film-maker, not a mathematician) 
- Brady 
↓↓↓

1. Because it is fun and creative - and playing with new ideas is good for your brain. 
2. Because you never know what ""bending the rules"" will teach you - what techniques, insights and breakthroughs will occur that may have more useful applications... Just look at much of John Conway's work... So much playfulness and so many games - yet many ideas and insightful mathematics has fallen out of that. 

Lunar arithmetic is never going to be used to build a bridge or design an iPhone (I certainly hope not!!!)... But neither is it just throwing ALL rules out of the window... It is creating a new arbitrary set of rules and seeing what happens... 

What IS a prime number in this new landscape? What pattern do the squares follow? And what light might that shed on more conventional mathematics? 

Also... If you are not buying that and think it's just nonsensical playing... I say the following... 

It may be true that this will not cure cancer or help people live longer - but what is the point of living longer if we can't play, imagine, and do fun stuff like this?

And if you think this is just child's play - read the paper: https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL14/Sloane/carry2.pdf","['numberphile', 'moon', 'lunar arithmetic', 'squares', 'prime numbers']",2018-11-07T11:40:49Z,421746,10596,0,1369,PT12M58S,hd,true

A NOTE ON THIS VIDEO:
A few of our Tadashi videos blur the already blurry line between mathematics and physics... Some people suggest they may be a better fit on Brady's dedicated physics channel (called Sixty Symbols).

In response, the reasons they are on Numberphile are:

1) Tadashi, while certainly a modern polymath, is based in a mathematics department.
2) This sub series (with its animation and extra production work) has been supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, a Numberphile collaborator.
3) Some of the previous and future Tadashi videos are more math-oriented than physics - and it just makes sense to put them on one channel rather than dividing the series between two channels on an ad hoc basis.

In a multi-disciplinary world, it is challenging to run YouTube channels which people come to associate with just one discipline.

That said, feel free to go over and watch hundreds of physics videos on Sixty Symbols --- https://www.youtube.com/sixtysymbols","['numberphile', 'lift', 'wings', 'pressure', 'ball', 'pipe']",2018-06-21T14:28:58Z,222086,8582,0,543,PT11M37S,hd,true

Note on this video: Ben uses ""one over a number"" quite often during the video to make a fraction of a turn between 0 and 1, but the same effects apply if you turn more than a complete turn (e.g. sqrt(2) = approximately 1.414... of a turn, i.e. 1 whole turn and 0.414... of a further turn).

194,A8Tiba3h9Fw,Numberphile,Don Bradman's Duck - Numberphile,"One of the most famous stories from the sort of cricket involves numbers, averages, and a duck.
More links & stuff in full description below ↓↓↓

Archive footage courtesy of AP Archive:
https://www.youtube.com/c/aparchive

* Batting average list shown was current in December 2017. It includes one still active player (Australian Steve Smith) whose average will change. It is a list that uses a threshold of 20 matches minimum. Different lists use different minimums for matches, innings, or runs scored to weed out freakish cases.

** Comparing athletes, especially across sports, is notoriously difficult and more of a conversation starter than exact science. An interesting article here: https://www.statslife.org.uk/sports/1989-did-don-bradman-s-cricketing-genius-make-him-a-statistical-outlier

*** A lower ""not out"" score in Bradman's next innings would also have made a 100+ average possible, but that's a very unlikely scenario in the ""first innings"" of a match. I did not want the video getting bogged down by intricacies and unlikely scenarios. In case you are curious, here is the scorecard for the next match Australia played... http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Matches/MatchScorecard.asp?MatchCode=0318

A NOTE ON THIS VIDEO:
A few of our Tadashi videos blur the already blurry line between mathematics and physics... Some people suggest they may be a better fit on Brady's dedicated physics channel (called Sixty Symbols).

In response, the reasons they are on Numberphile are:

1) Tadashi, while certainly a modern polymath, is based in a mathematics department.
2) This sub series (with its animation and extra production work) has been supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, a Numberphile collaborator.
3) Some of the previous and future Tadashi videos are more math-oriented than physics - and it just makes sense to put them on one channel rather than dividing the series between two channels on an ad hoc basis.

In a multi-disciplinary world, it is challenging to run YouTube channels which people come to associate with just one discipline.

That said, feel free to go over and watch hundreds of physics videos on Sixty Symbols --- https://www.youtube.com/sixtysymbols","['numberphile', 'kamifusen', 'paper balloon']",2017-11-17T11:32:49Z,549296,17026,0,869,PT5M27S,hd,true

Envy free cake cutting (the paper mentioned): https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03655

A clarifying note from Hannah: n^n^n^n^n^n is the maximum number of cuts in the n person case.

Something we could have made clearer... Bob's trimmed piece still carries the status of his ""first choice"", so if Charlie leaves it, Bob will (must) pick it... otherwise he'll pick the one that was his original ""second choice""... The upshot of this is that there's no chance Alice will be left with the trimmed piece after everyone takes their first piece. And Bob remains envy free under these conditions too.

Professor McKee explains: ""Most of the digits of p were fixed so that: (i) the top two thirds made the desired pattern; (ii) the bottom third ensured that p-1 had a nice large (composite) factor F with the factorisation of F known.  Numbers of this shape can easily be checked for primality.  A small number of digits (you can see which!) were looped over until p was found that was prime.""

Notes from Tony on this video:

1.  The numbers I use are based on Planck 2013 data. Data from the 2015 release exists but I chose the 2013 data since the precise calculation of the size of the universe has only been done explicitly in that case as per this paper: http://www.isaacpub.org/images/PaperPDF/AdAp_100039_2016122914005354452.pdf

2. Near the start I say I’m only considering fundamental particles with mass, and not, say, photons. Actually, I don’t count neutrinos either since they too are relativistic, and the precise results are model dependent to an extent.

3 (later addendum). Well done to anyone who spotted the fact that the 75:25% split between H and He ought to be by mass, and not by number of atoms, as in the video. I realised this mistake lying in bed on the night the video was released and kicked myself repeatedly! Very annoying. Anyway, correcting for this, we see that there actually ought to be 12 H atoms for each He atom, since the atom mass of He is 4, and the total atomic mass of 12 H atoms is 12=3x4.   Following the same sort of logic as in the video, we find that  there are 62=12x4+14 particles for 16=12+4 baryons. Thats means we should have multiplied by 62/16 rather than 26/7, and so our result should be corrected by a factor of 1.04, yielding closer to 3.4 x 10^80 particles. [Of course, no-one really worries about factors of 1.04 in cosmology :)]. The time to the ""apocalyptic” end mentioned later in the video then changes by 3 to 4 years, which is anyway well within the rounding errors of the calculation.","['numberphile', 'particles', 'universe']",2017-07-10T17:07:36Z,548061,16081,0,1534,PT9M57S,hd,true

A NOTE ON THIS VIDEO:
A few of our Tadashi videos blur the already blurry line between mathematics and physics... Some people suggest they may be a better fit on Brady's dedicated physics channel (called Sixty Symbols).

In response, the reasons they are on Numberphile are:

1) Tadashi, while certainly a modern polymath, is based in a mathematics department.
2) This sub series (with its animation and extra production work) has been supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, a Numberphile collaborator.
3) Some of the previous and future Tadashi videos are more math-oriented than physics - and it just makes sense to put them on one channel rather than dividing the series between two channels on an ad hoc basis.

In a multi-disciplinary world, it is challenging to run YouTube channels which people come to associate with just one discipline.

That said, feel free to go over and watch hundreds of physics videos on Sixty Symbols --- https://www.youtube.com/sixtysymbols","['numberphile', 'cats', 'relection', 'focal point', 'cookie cutter']",2017-04-07T14:00:01Z,319238,10163,0,473,PT3M30S,hd,true

A NOTE ON THIS VIDEO:
A few of our Tadashi videos blur the already blurry line between mathematics and physics... Some people suggest they may be a better fit on Brady's dedicated physics channel (called Sixty Symbols).
In response, the reasons they are on Numberphile are:
1) Tadashi, while certainly a modern polymath, is based in a mathematics department.
2) This sub series (with its animation and extra production work) has been supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, a Numberphile collaborator.
3) Some of the previous and future Tadashi videos are more math-oriented than physics - and it just makes sense to put them on one channel rather than dividing the series between two channels on an ad hoc basis.
In a multi-disciplinary world, it is challenging to run YouTube channels which people come to associate with just one discipline.

A NOTE ON THIS VIDEO:
A few of our Tadashi videos blur the already blurry line between mathematics and physics... Some people suggest they may be a better fit on Brady's dedicated physics channel (called Sixty Symbols).

In response, the reasons they are on Numberphile are:

1) Tadashi, while certainly a modern polymath, is based in a mathematics department.
2) This sub series (with its animation and extra production work) has been supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, a Numberphile collaborator.

A NOTE ON THIS VIDEO:
A few of our Tadashi videos blur the already blurry line between mathematics and physics... Some people suggest they may be a better fit on Brady's dedicated physics channel (called Sixty Symbols).

In response, the reasons they are on Numberphile are:

1) Tadashi, while certainly a modern polymath, is based in a mathematics department.
2) This sub series (with its animation and extra production work) has been supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, a Numberphile collaborator.
3) Some of the previous and future Tadashi videos are more math-oriented than physics - and it just makes sense to put them on one channel rather than dividing the series between two channels on an ad hoc basis.

In a multi-disciplinary world, it is challenging to run YouTube channels which people come to associate with just one discipline.

Hey, why did you make this two videos and not just one?
Because two videos would have been very long and deterred casual viewers from even learning about the problem.
Makes more sense to make a video which describes the problem  and the solution, plus its history and the fact a one sentence proof exists... then have a more technical second video for people who want to see the proof itself. I have made links to the second video as clear as possible and I suspect more technical fans subscribe to Numberphile2 anyway.

Postscript note from Cliff: ""Cliff says he forgot to mention that at each point, he calls an outward going curve positive, and an inward going curve negative.  He also neglected to say that saddle points have negative Gaussian curvature.  Finally, he insists that the frozen pizza shown in this video is inferior to his wife's homemade pizza.  But both have zero Gaussian curvature.""

Film by Pete McPartlan (who did the animations) and Brady Haran.

NOTE: Due to the limitations of cameras and YouTube compression, we adjusted some frame rates in editing in an attempt to better show the spinning tubes as they appeared to the naked eye. Still not sure how well we did, so please take Tadashi's word for it when he describes what we see! The best thing to do is make one yourself and just try it... It's actually quite easy.

Note from Brady: In a previous video I ""under explained"" the true magnitude of Graham's Number. This is because my brain is small. Apologies to Professor Graham who has a big brain and unsurprisingly explained his number flawlessly. This video is designed as a correction that can also stand alone. It will be our last Graham's Number video (for a little while, at least!)

More links & stuff in full description below ↓↓↓

If the highest power of a function or polynomial is odd 
(e.g.: x^3 or x^5 or x^4371) then it definitely has a solution (or root) among the real numbers. Here's a nice proof demonstrated by Prof David Eisenbud from the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.

At 10:33 Prof Eisenbud intended to say ""no rational roots"" rather than ""no real roots"".

At 2:52 we should have put (2,5) rather than (2,4).

Also, Prof Eisenbud adds that ""The Dedekind cut corresponding to the root is: (Rationals x where f(x) is less than or equal to zero) + (Rationals x where f(x) is greater than zero)""

BRADY'S ATTEMPT AT ARRANGING THE CARDS
I will put my humiliation on the BradyStuff channel - but it will come at a price.
I'm trying to raise money for cancer research - anyone who donates will get the secret link to my embarrassing video.
And if the total gets to £1200 (from its starting point of £944) I'll just put the link on the fundraising page so everyone can see it.

Money goes to cancer research via the Just Giving Page so even if the link has become ""public"", please still consider a donation if you can afford it --- cancer is bad news and we should be fighting it...

THE LINK: http://bit.ly/numberphilecancercharity",['numberphile'],2014-04-27T11:16:41Z,490552,8640,0,403,PT6M16S,hd,true

Ricci Flow was used to finally crack the Poincaré Conjecture. It was devised by Richard Hamilton but famously employed by Grigori Perelman in his acclaimed proof. It is named after mathematician Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro.

In this video it is discussed by James Isenberg from the University of Oregon (filmed here at MSRI).

Primer on Kickstarter: http://bit.ly/primerkick Karl: http://bit.ly/karllautman Get an original Numberphile brown paper: http://bit.ly/brownpapers

Dr James Grime discusses ""The Primer"" sent to us by artist Karl Lautman.

See our prime number videos... http://bit.ly/primevids

PLEASE NOTE: Numberphile is not associated with Karl's project and does not benefit from it. He sent us the sculptures without warning or promise of publicity... We just liked it and wanted to support a great numbery idea.

Also note we do not vouch for Karl's product. In fact, the model sent to Brady has fallen out of sync on a couple of occasions and required re-calibration (using the instructions supplied by Karl with each model)... But we still think it's great and have had fun with it! Thanks Karl.

More links & stuff in full description below ↓↓↓

Videos features Matt Parker who tweets at https://twitter.com/standupmaths

The Pi-inspired music in the video explained: http://periodicvideos.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/pimusic.html

Our full collection of Pi videos at http://bit.ly/W4oDN1

While the pies are usually delicious, this batch was not for consumption (even by hungry students, for those who suggested it!) but we feel they were used in a fun way to make people think about mathematics - perhaps some people who would not otherwise take an interest... To mark Pi Day we instead donated £314 to a local charity which helps feed people in crisis.

If you'd like to make a donation, here are some suggestions:

Matt is a supporter of Depaul UK, helping young homless people. You can donate through their website: http://www.depauluk.org/

Numberphile's donation was to a local group which does not have online donation facilities.

However here are some other options...
http://www.wfp.org/
http://www.foodcycle.org.uk/
http://www.napsoc.org/

Contact us with any others you'd like on the list!

Numberphile also raises money for cancer research if you'd prefer - donate here: http://www.justgiving.com/numberphile-charity

Special thanks to Pukka Pies (for the pies), Notts Country FC (for hosting us) and the football channel Copa90 (for helping us out) - http://www.youtube.com/user/Copa90football - plus James Hennessy for being second camera!

More links & stuff in full description below ↓↓↓

An extra note from Dr Grime: ""Since pi39 ends in 0, you may think we could use pi38 instead - which has even fewer digits. Unfortunately, the rounding errors of pi38 are ten times larger than the rounding errors of pi39 - more than a hyrdogen atom. So that extra decimal place makes a difference, even if it's 0.""

Professor Copeland on Keith numbers, clusters and ""reverse Keiths"".
More links & stuff in full description below ↓↓↓

And before commenting on the merits of ""recreational maths"" - hear what Ed says. Ed tweets at https://twitter.com/ProfEdCopeland

Keith Numbers are also known as repfigit numbers (repetitive Fibonacci-like digit).

We also spoke with Mike Keith about his numbers and he issued a playful challenge:

""There are many variations on this idea that you can imagine.  For example, for a 3-digit number, instead of the next term being a+b+c (a,b,c being the three previous terms) it could be a+2b+3c, or a^2 + b + c or even more fancifully, 2a + b + the cth prime number.  You could think up your own version, and name it after yourself!""

Speaking of fitness, can you see someone solving the cube on a treadmill?

How many animated ""self-solving"" cubes appear?

Can you spot the underwater cube?

Someone is cubing while singing along to a Justin Bieber song? Can you spot them?

How many cubes appear which are not the standard 3x3?

Did you spot a magic trick?

Can you guess which video is a self-admitted forgery (not the ""magic trick"" but someone else using visual effects and not really doing it - and this doesn't include sped-up videos)

There are only three pairs of Brown Numbers - and only five of the numbers themselves (because 5 is repeated)... At least we think that's all of them? No-one has proven it. This is called Brocard's Problem and has been entertained by great mathematicians such as Paul Erdos.

The Brown Numbers are (5,4) (11,5) and (71,7).

Professor Phil Moriarty is a physicist (and wannabe rocker) at the University of Nottingham. His blog about this song is at: http://periodicvideos.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/metallizing-phi-by-phil-moriarty.html (it has all the gory details)

A note from James about a mistake he made discussing the primes proof: ""I attributed the theorem to Tim Gowers when I should have attributed it to Green and Tao. See what I did - they have the same initials! Between the three of them, Green and Tao and Tim Gowers, they're responsible for all the major stuff to do with that theorem - and they have the same initials! And references use initials!! Gah. Ben Green is also a Cambridge mathematician.""

And a note from Brady: ""Sorry this got through... James was speaking unscripted and as you can hear was responding to an unexpected question... Mistakes are inevitable in this situation but we still hate them and correct them when we can.""

This video features Thomas Woolley from the University of Oxford.

Tom thanks @gameboygenius for pointing out the following: Small mistake. I think where you said they expected MR ∝ r^(2/3) you actually meant to say MR ∝ m^(2/3). If you take the r/V/A relations and solve for A, you get A ∝ V^(2/3). Mass is proportional to volume, so roughly  A ∝ m^(2/3). If we then assume MR is proportional to area, the final assumption would be MR ∝ m^(2/3).""

645,LxgMdjyw8uw,Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell,We WILL Fix Climate Change!,"Visit https://brilliant.org/nutshell/ to get started learning STEM for free, and the first 200 people will get 20% off their annual premium subscription.

Sources & further reading:
https://sites.google.com/view/sources-can-we-fix-climate/

Our home is burning. Rapid climate change is destabilizing our world. It seems our emissions will not fall quickly enough to avoid runaway warming and we may soon hit tipping points that will lead to the collapse of ecosystems and our civilization.

While scientists, activists and much of the younger generation urge action, it appears most politicians are not committed to do anything meaningful while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change. It seems humanity can’t overcome its greed and obsession with short term profit and personal gain to save itself. 

And so for many the future looks grim and hopeless. Young people feel particularly anxious and depressed. Instead of looking ahead to a lifetime of opportunity they wonder if they will even have a future or if they should bring kids into this world. It’s an age of doom and hopelessness and giving up seems the only sensible thing to do. 

But that’s not true. You are not doomed. Humanity is not doomed.

When we think about alien civilizations we tend to look into the vastness of space, to far away planets. But there is another incredibly vast dimension that we might be giving too little thought to: time.
Could it be that over the last hundreds of millions of years, other civilizations existed on earth? Indigenous technological species that rose and died out? And that they or their artifacts are buried beneath our feet? What does science have to say about this and what are the implications for us?

The Universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars, at just 0.1% of the speed of light, It could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years. Which is not that long given the billions of years the milky way has existed – so in principle any spacefaring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy. And yet we see nothing, hear nothing, the universe seems empty. Devoid of others. This is the Fermi Paradox, which we have discussed in more detail in other videos.

Confronted with the seemingly empty universe, humanity faces a dilemma. We desperately want to know if we are alone in the Milky Way. We want to call out and reveal ourselves to anyone watching but that could be the last thing we ever do. Because maybe the universe is not empty. Maybe it’s full of civilizations but they are hiding from each other. Maybe the civilizations that attracted attention in the past were wiped away by invisible arrows. This is the Dark Forest solution to the Fermi paradox.

Kurzgesagt is lying to you, in every video, even in this one. Because our videos distill very complex subjects into flashy ten minute videos and unfortunately, reality is, well, complicated.

Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old. It is an expression of culture, our parents' love and a means of celebration or comfort. That’s why it hits a special nerve when we are told we should change what and how we eat to fight rapid climate change. One of the most delicious foods, meat, gets the worst press. It doesn’t help that the topic is really hard to properly research yourself and debates get emotional quickly. But clearly science can give us an answer! 

The reality is, well, it’s complicated. Let’s take a look at three climate arguments against meat that are used a lot and see what happens.

You are not a person, you are a planet, made of roughly 40 trillion cells. There is so much of you, that if your cells were human-sized, you would be as big as  20 Mount Everests. For your creepy-crawly inhabitants, this makes your body an ecosystem, rich in resources and warmth and space. A perfect place to move into and have a family. While some of these guests are welcome, most are not. Your immune system is the guardian of this planet, the force tasked with protecting yourself against the constant danger of invasion.

The past is a vast and mysterious land that begins at the big bang and ends in the present, expanding with each passing moment. It is the home of everything that came before, the key to understanding our present. Here we find the most amazing creatures to ever roam our planet, hundreds of millions of species so diverse that our imagination cannot do them justice. Unfortunately the past carefully guards its secrets.

Never before in human history have we been richer, more advanced or powerful. And yet we feel overwhelmed in the face of rapid climate change. It seems simple on the surface. Greenhouse gases trap energy from the Sun and transfer it to our atmosphere. This leads to warmer winters, harsher summers. Dry places become drier and wet places wetter. Countless ecosystems will die while the rising oceans swallow coasts and the cities we build on them. 

So why don’t we just like… prevent all of that? Well, it’s complicated.

Hidden in the microverse all around you, there is a merciless war being fought by the true rulers of this planet, microorganisms. Amoebae, protists, bacteria, archaea and fungi compete for resources and space. And then there are the strange horrors that are viruses, hunting everyone else. Not even being alive, they are the tiniest, most abundant and deadliest beings on earth, killing trillions every day. Not interested in resources, only in living things to take over. Or so we thought. 
It turns out that there are giant viruses that blur the line between life and death – and other viruses hunting them.

The human immune system is the most complex biological system we know, after the human brain, and yet, most of us never learn how it works. Or what it is. Your immune System consists of hundreds of tiny and two large organs, it has its own transport network spread throughout your body. Every day it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells. 

It is not some sort of abstract entity. Your immune system is YOU. Your biology protecting you from the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer. It's so manifold that it is impossible to cover in one video, so we’ll make a series looking at different aspects of it. 

Today, what happens when your body is invaded and your first lines of defenses are engaged in a fight for life and death?

The largest things in the universe are black holes. In contrast to things like planets or stars they have no physical size limit, and can literally grow endlessly. Although in reality specific things need to happen to create different kinds of black holes, from really tiny ones to the largest single things in the universe. So how do black holes grow and how large is the largest of them all?

Leaving earth to find new homes in space is an old dream of humanity and will sooner or later be necessary for our survival. The planet that gets the most attention is Mars, a small, toxic and energy poor planet that just about seems good enough for a colony of depressed humans huddled in underground cities. 

But what if we think bigger? What if we take Venus, one of the most hostile and deadly places in the solar system and turn it into a colony? Not by building lofty cloud cities, but by creating a  proper second earth? It might be easier than you think.

Wrapping your mind around your life is pretty hard, because you are up to your neck in it. It's like trying to understand the ocean while learning how to swim. On most days you are busy just keeping your head above water. So it is not easy to figure out what to do with your life and how to spend your time.

There are a million distractions. Your family, friends and romantic partners, boring work, and exciting projects. Video games to play and books to read. And then there is your couch that somebody needs to lie on. It’s easy to get lost. So let us take a step back and take a look at your life from the outside.

Do we need nuclear energy to stop climate change? More and more voices from science, environmental activists and the press have been saying so in recent years – but this comes as a shock to those who are fighting against nuclear energy and the problems that come with it. So who is right? Well - it is complicated.

The desire to be free from the limits of the human experience is as old as our first stories. We exist in an endless universe, only bound by the laws of physics and yet, our consciousness is trapped in mortal machines made of meat. With the breathtaking explosion of innovation and progress, for the first time the concept of leaving our flesh piles behind and uploading our minds into a digital utopia seems possible. Even like the logical next step on our evolutionary ladder.

The night sky seems peaceful and orderly. But in reality, stars are careening through the galaxy at speeds of hundreds of thousands of kilometres per hour. Not bound by static formations but changing neighbourhoods constantly. Fortunately space is big, and so the stars of the Milky Way are very unlikely to hit us. Unfortunately, they don’t have to hit anything to make us have a really bad time on earth. And there are already stars starting to get very close.

In and out, in and out. Staying alive is about doing things. This very second, your cells are combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy available, which keeps you alive for another precious moment. To get the oxygen to your cells you are breathing.
Breathing is an answer to a very hard problem: How do you get the resources that your cells need to survive, from the outside, to the inside of your cells? Every living thing has to solve this problem and the solution is surprisingly different depending on one of the most important regulators of life: Size.

By the end of the 21st century, humanity is becoming desperate. Decades of heatwaves and droughts have led to unusually  poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famine and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north. As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan...
It is far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out. But the failure of world leaders  to effectively address climate change, makes it far from impossible. 
So in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change: Geoengineering. Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior. Or make everything much worse.
What is geoengineering, is it really an option and what if it goes wrong?

This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy – a coalition founded by Bill Gates, that is working to expand clean-energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero carbon emissions. 
https://www.gatesnotes.com/Climate-and-energy?WT.mc_id=20200625100000_ClimateCtr2020_CTRKurt-YT_&WT.tsrc=CTRKurtYT


Climate Change is just too much. There is never any good news. Only graphs that get more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid Glacier melt. It’s endless and relentless. 

We have known for decades that rapid Climate Change is being caused by the release of Greenhouse Gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it  so hard to just stop emitting these gases?

Deep in tropical jungles lie floating kingdoms ruled by beautiful and deadly masters: They are sort of the high elves of the ant kingdoms: Talented architects that create castles and city states. But they are also fierce and expansionist warriors and their kingdoms are ensnared in a never ending war for survival. Oecophylla weaver ants.

Getting rare materials from the ground into your phone is ugly. The mining industry is responsible for air and water pollution and the destruction of entire landscapes. But what if we could replace the mining industry on Earth with a clean process that can’t harm anyone? Well, we can. All we need to do is look up.

The observable universe is a big place that has been around for more than 13 billion years. Up to two trillion galaxies made up of  something like 20,000 billion billion stars surround our home galaxy. In the milky way alone scientists assume there are some 40 billion earth like planets in the habitable zone of their stars. When we look at these numbers it is hard to imagine  that there is nobody else out there.

This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy – a coalition founded by Bill Gates, that is working to expand clean-energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero carbon emissions.

Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have released over 1.5 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide or CO2 into the earth's atmosphere.  In the year 2019  we were still pumping out  around 37 billion more.  That’s 50% more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it’s not just CO2. We’re also pumping out growing volumes  of  other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we’re emitting 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. 
And emissions keep rising – but they need to get down to 0!

The sun. Smooth and round and peaceful. Except when it suddenly vomits radiation and plasma in random directions. These solar flares and coronal mass ejections, or CMEs can hit earth and have serious consequences for humanity. 

How exactly do they work, how bad could they be and can we prepare for them?

In September of 1940, an 18-year-old mechanic named Marcel Ravidat was walking his dog, Robot, in the countryside of Southwestern France when the dog disappeared down a hole. Robot eventually returned but the next day, Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole.

And after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a wooly rhinoceros. The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube, possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave. It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old.

At this very second, you are on a narrow ledge between life and death. You probably don’t feel  it, but there is an incredible amount of activity going on inside you. And this activity can never stop.

Picture  yourself as a slinky falling down an escalator moving upwards – the falling part represents the self replicating processes of your cells, the escalator represents  the laws of physics, driving you forwards. To be alive is to be in motion but never arriving anywhere. If you reach the top of the escalator there is no more falling possible and you are dead forever. 

Somewhat unsettlingly, the universe wants you to reach the top. How do you avoid that and why are you alive?

A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with the video. Especially “Our World in Data”, the online publication for research and data on the world’s largest problems – and how to make progress solving them. Check out their site. It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona Pandemic.

In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the “Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2”, that causes the disease called COVID19, and that everyone simply calls Coronavirus.

What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do?

▼▼ More infos and links are just a click away ▼▼

Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing. While we tried to understand it, to get better at killing it, we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day: large animals seem to be immune to cancer. Which doesn’t make any sense – the bigger a being, the more cancer it should have. To understand why, we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.

Over the last decade milk has become a bit controversial. Some people say it’s a necessary and nutritious food, vital for healthy bones, but others say it can cause cancer and lead to an early death.

So who is right? And why are we drinking it anyway?

Get your Stellar Engine Infographic Poster here:
https://shop.kurzgesagt.org

Nothing in the Universe is static. In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.
Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.

This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.

Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.

If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn’t do much about it.

Unless… we move our whole solar system out of the way.

https://sites.google.com/view/sourcesoverpopulationandafrica

For most of our history, the human population grew slowly. Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled. 
This led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.   
But the big picture conceals  the details. 

Let us look at one region in particular: 
Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.
While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. 
Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. 
So is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?

Everybody is familiar with the feeling that things are not as they should be. That you are not successful enough, your relationships not satisfying enough. That you don’t have the things you crave.

In this video we want to talk about one of the strongest predictors of how happy people are, how easily they make friends and how good they are at dealing with hardship. An antidote against dissatisfaction so to speak: Gratitude.

Getting to space is incredibly hard, expensive and needs a lot of resources. 
A more efficient way to get there is a Skyhook (or Spacetether), an ever rotating cable with a counter weight, that catapults spaceships from earth orbit into the depths of space.

Neutron stars are one of the most extreme and violent things in the universe. Giant atomic nuclei, only a few kilometers in diameter but as massive as stars. And they owe their existence to the death of something majestic.

As you may have noticed, we like to blow stuff up on this channel. So when the International Red Cross approached us to collaborate on a video about nuclear weapons, we were more than excited.
Until we did the research. It turned out we were a bit oblivious off the real impact of nuclear weapons in the real world, on a real city. And especially, how helpless even the most developed nations on earth would be if an attack occurred today.
So hopefully this video demonstrates how extremely non fun a real world nuclear attack would be, without being too gruesome. This collaboration was a blast (no pun intended) and we want to say a huge thank you to the International Red Cross!

In nearly every corner of the Earth, ants wage war against each other. Their weapons are what nature gave them. Some have strong armour, deadly stingers or sharp mandibles. And then there is this tiny, and not very impressive ant. But it rules the biggest empire any ant has ever built. A colony spanning continents and fighting wars that leave  millions of casualties. Let’s take a look at this unlikely warrioress: Linepithema humile, the Argentine ant.

Electronic devices emit an electromagnetic field, which is suspected to cause cancer. We read countless sources on this topic to summarize the results of the latest research for you.

Nuclear Energy is a controversial subject. The pro- and anti-nuclear lobbies fight furiously, and it's difficult to decide who is right. So we're trying to clear up the issue - in this video we discuss how we got to where we are today, as the basis for discussion. Next week we'll be looking at the arguments for and against nuclear power in detail.

Bacteria, viruses, spores and more living stuff wants to enter your body and use its resources for itself. The immune system is a powerful army of cells that fights like a T-Rex on speed and sacrifices itself for your survival. Without it you would die in no time. This sounds simple but the reality is complex, beautiful and just awesome. An animation of the immune system.

786,AQPlREDW-Ro,Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell,"Iraq Explained -- ISIS, Syria and War","The current crisis in Iraq explained in under 5 minutes.

There is war in Iraq? Again? And the US and Iran are talking about working together? And who is this ISIS Terrorist group that is all over the news? And Religion? Oh dear... When exactly has the world gone mad again? 

It is not possible to explain a complicated topic like this without simplification. We are very aware that this video is not painting a full picture of the situation. But we hope that it may lay the foundation on which you can try to do your own research and understand how horribly Fu**ed up the whole situation is. 

We did have to produce the video super fast -- thanks a lot to our friends Martin Wackerbauer and Magnus Schlüter for helping us out -- we would not have been able to make this video in time without you guys!

Kurzgesagt loves all people as long as they don't hurt others and don't hinder mankind on its quest to the stars. So it was very sad to read so much terrible stuff about the situation in Iraq. Hopefully it will get better.

791,xRF7WIZV4lA,Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell,Help us make more Videos for Kurzgesagt,"We started a crowd funding to make it possible to make more than one video every four weeks.

http://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt

Patreon is a monthly subscription service that you can use to support the online creators you like! 

Kurzgesagt has gone through the roof in terms of views and subscriptions and it already is way to time intensive that we can properly take care of everything. 
That's the reason why we still haven't proper subtitles (despite of so many of you guys offering to make them for us!), that's why our website is still a mess and we take weeks to reply to emails. And of course that we only make one video each month and never know when we will be finished.

So, to solve this hot mess, we are trying to make Kurzgesagt at least a viable ""part time job"" so we can use ""daytime"" to catch up with everything and make more stuff while not risking our livelihood.

Lots of you guys wrote us in the last few months and wanted to support us, well, now you can! If you don't want to or don't have the money to spare, no worries! 

KURZGESAGT WILL ALWAYS BE A SEMI MONTHLY THING THAT IS FREE FOR EVERYBODY!

We really appreciate everyone who helps us out and we officially give you moral absolution for using add block if you fund us.

We didn't start this whole operation to get rich but because it is our passion. And we continue it because it feels right and because of the feedback we get from all of you. It has been a lot of work and a lot of fun. 
Thank you so much everybody. Words can not express how we feel about Kurzgesagt and the amazing people it attracted. Thank you for your attention. We are humbled and amazed by all of you.

Who was the genius who came up with all of that? The internet is such a crucial tool in our daily lives today that we hardly remember that it hasn't been here forever. But yeah, it is actually not that old. We still have fuzzy memories about the time before the first thing in the morning was to check email and browse our favorite blogs and youtube channels. Well, let's explore how the internet came into existence and why. 

And another Kurzgesagt video that isn't depressing! Don't get used to it though. 

We funny comments at the end of the video are real comments from real people, from old YGS Episodes from Jacksfilms: youtube.com/jacksfilms

Has the universe a beginning or was it here since forever? Well, evidence suggests that there was indeed a starting point to this universe we are part of right now. But how can this be? How can something come from nothing? And what about time? We don't have all the answers yet so let's talk about what we know.

Also, we try to make this one not depressing. Tell us if we succeeded. 

BY THE WAY. We have a website now. We'll try to blog from time to time, show you guys how we make the videos and give more insight to our process. Also we sell stuff. We really don't know where this whole kurzgesagt stuff leads us. But we are really thankful for all the attention and positive feedback and yeah, maybe we can make this our jobs -- it would be pretty nice and we could do more content each month. But we'll see. For now, thank you very much everybody for making this little adventure possible.

Everyday in the news we hear about the stock exchange, stocks and money moving around the globe.

798,Uti2niW2BRA,Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell,Fracking explained: opportunity or danger,"Fracking explained in five minutes.

Fracking is a controversial topic. On the one side the gas drilling companies, on the other citizen opposed to this drilling method. Politicians are also divided on the matter.
We try to take a neutral look on fracking. It is relevant for all of us, because of high prices for energy and the danger for our drinking water.
This video focuses mostly on the debate currently ongoing in europe. In a lot of european countries there is a public outcry against fracking, espacially in germany. But the facts in this video are relevant to all of us.

Short videos, explaining things. For example Evolution, the Universe, Stock Market or controversial topics like Fracking. Because we love science.

The theory of evolution explains how the enormous variety of life could come into existence. How it is possible for primitive life forms to spawn the millions of different creatures, that exist today. Unfortunately, evolution is often misunderstood, because it's mechanisms seem counter intuitive. By using visualizations, infographics and appealing characters, the viewer is more likely to understand it the complex information. More than that, by presenting the information in an entertaining way, the information is more likely to sink in.

Exercises in this video: 
1. A box and a sphere are sliding and rolling, respectively, down a ramp. If they start from the same height, and we ignore friction on the box, which will reach the ground first?
What if it were a full soda can and an empty soda can?

2. A sphere of mass 4kg rolls down a ramp, starting with a height of 5 meters from the ground.  How fast is the sphere rolling when it gets to the ground?

3. If every person on Earth ran around the equator in the same direction, what would their total angular momentum be? Use 65 kg as the average mass of the 7.8 billion people on Earth, and let them run at 5m/s.

4. Given 8 x 10³⁷ kg•m² as the Moment of Inertia of Earth, by how much would all those people running change  the angular speed of the Earth?

Exercises in this video:

Problem 1: You push your square space cow, mass 5kg, with a force of 10N. What will be the acceleration of your space cow? 

Problem 2: Your tiny cow has a mass of 1kg and is standing in a field in Kansas. What force does Earth’s gravity exert on the cow?

Problem 3: You are suspending two cows from the ceiling, one below the other. You have really strange hobbies. The lower cow has a mass of 2kg. The upper cow has a mass of 1kg. What is the tension in the rope between the top cow and the ceiling?

Problem 4: Now you have two square cows, one mass 4kg, the other mass 2kg, lined up on a frictionless surface. You push on the first cow such that the two cows accelerate at 2 m/s^2. What force does the second cow exert on the first?

PROBLEM 1
A girl is riding her bike with a constant velocity of 10 m/s.  How far has she gone after 7 seconds?  Graph her motion both in x vs t, and v vs. t.  Show her displacement on both graphs.

PROBLEM 2
A driver is driving at a constant velocity of 20 m/s.  She steps on the gas at t=0 and accelerates to 30 m/s with constant acceleration.  It took her 4 seconds to accelerate.  How far did she go in those 4 seconds?  Graph her motion on a v vs t graph and show the displacement on that graph.

PROBLEM 3
A biker, biking at 10 m/s hits a tree and comes to a complete stop.  Assuming a helmet “crumple zone” of 10 cm, what is the minimum acceleration her head could undergo?  How many “g”s is that?

SAFETY TIPS FOR TEA BAG ROCKET 
• Flammable surfaces: DO NOT light tea bags on a flammable surface. Experiment should be conducted on a fireproof surface, like a metal pan. 
• Smoke detectors: Do not light tea bags under or near smoke detectors
• Safety Glasses: Safety glasses should be used
• Touching fire: Do not allow anyone else to touch the lighter or the burning tea bag
• Falling ash: Be aware! Some ashes may be produced from the teabag, and they may fly into the air.

Current estimate of Antimatter, courtesy of Elise: 
Stefan Ulmer made a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on energy and power consumption. The explanation goes as follows:  
1.       CERN produces 3e7 antiprotons per AD cycle or about 1e15 per year
2.       This is about 1e15*1.67e-27kg = 1.67 nanogram per year
3.       1 gram of antiprotons has an energy (E=mc^2) of 9e13 Joule
4.       The efficiency of the antiproton production process is 1e-9, so you need a billion times more energy: 9e22 Joule
5.       The cost of power for CERN is 1kWh = 3.6e6 Joule = 0.1 euro
6.       So that would make 0.1/3.6e6*9e22 = 2.5e15 euro
7.       And it would take CERN 6e8 years

863,zfqpYDVhXd8,Physics Girl,How We’ll Find the Aliens in Our Solar System! | STELLAR,"Thank you to Draper and its Hack the Moon initiative for supporting PBS Digital Studios | Learn more at https://wehackthemoon.com. 

I got to visit two awesome upcoming NASA missions searching for life in our solar system! The Mars 2020 rover mission targeting the Jezero Crater and the Europa Clipper reconnaissance mission to explore one of Jupiter's moons due to launch in 2023. I explore if alien life is possible, where we're most likely to find it and why. 

I know, this video is a bit different from most Physics Girl videos. It's part of a PBS miniseries called Stellar, done in collaboration with Matt O’Dowd from @PBSSpacetime and Joe Hanson from @It'sOkayToBeSmart. Over six episodes we travel to telescopes, go inside space research centers, and chat with amazing scientists. Next up is Joe's episode where he explores where life might be outside our solar system.

This edition of the Physics Girl Everyday Mysteries series is a physics experiment uses a quirk of the voice and your vocal cords. Try it at home! 

Prof Joe Wolfe’s acoustics website: http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/ 
Intro chapter on the voice: http://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/waves-sound/human-sound/index.html
Wade et al paper on soprano singing through resonances: https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/2.0000354 

More on vocal tract resonances: http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/soprane.html
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15532674

More facts: Most objects have a number of different resonant frequencies. The first resonance of the pipe were were using was around 70 Hz, which was lower than any of us could sing. A bass singer could hit that note, but were were singing in the range of the second and third resonances of the pipe.

906,qFOX3AO2FjE,Physics Girl,This phenomenon only happens in Hawaii . . . and Cuba & Nigeria & Indonesia & Peru & Sudan & Laos &…,"There are apparently no shadows in these images. But they were taken during the brightest part of the day.
This episode is brought to you by Squarespace: http://www.squarespace.com/physicsgirl

There are only certain parts of the year and certain times of day when you can experience the subsolar point or Lahaina noon. There appears to be no shadow because the sun is directly overhead. This phenomenon happens twice a year for latitudes between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn at solar noon, when the sun is highest in the sky. But you have to be in the right place at the right time with no clouds! The photos and clips in this video were taken by my mom, Cathy, and friend Noel Liddell in Wailua, Po’ipu and Lawai, HI on July 11th (one day before exact Lahaina noon) and July 12th.

Thanks to non-profit edX.org for sponsoring this video. Go to http://bit.ly/edXPhysicsGirl to learn more about MIT's Circuits and Electronics course or other classes from some of the top universities in the world.

Quantum entanglement involves a special process of splitting photons into two. But it involves a process and a crystal that can split photons. How does that lead to entangled particles?

To find out more about the specifics of how to entangle photons, check out this awesome video from whentheappledrops https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCljzqHkHI

The zero g plane, also known as a parabolic flight, or the vomit comet, flies in parabolic trajectories to give a brief experience of weightlessness. This flight, operated by Novespace in Bordeaux, France, offered 14 weightless parabolas, 2 parabolas with a simulation of moon gravity, and one with Mars gravity. I brought some demos to try out on the vomit comet, with little to no success. But who can ever prepare for these weightless things? Watch to find out whether I threw up!

When we cut the electricity to an inductor, we get a sudden intense spark across the switch. This is known as inductive kickback or a back EMF and is produced because of Faraday’s Law of Induction. Not mean to be tried at home! The inductor doesn’t want to change its current, so the change in magnetic field creates an EMF resulting in a high voltage across the switch. #PHYSICS

A quantum video to start with:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-MNSLsjjdo

Make giant sparks by building up static charge on a homemade 2-plate capacitor, and discharging through a grounded rod. Watch as my friend Ashley agrees to touch the charged-up capacitor. How is it possible to touch such a high voltage? Well, the spark looks dramatic, but the bowl can only hold a small, limited amount of charge, so the current is low. 

The inspiration for this video and tips on how to improve the capacitor were thanks to Scott at notabs.org. Original video here with an impressive 10 inch spark! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWGIYd4W5_A

926,gUPbysSt7XU,Physics Girl,How to control light with water,"How fast is the internet? How fast can we send data? This easy DIY experiment allows you to control light with water! Drill a hole in the bottom of a 2 liter bottle, fill the bottle with water allowing the water to stream out the hole, and a shine a laser on the other side so it comes out the hole and follows the stream of water! Just like fiber optics, the laser beam gets bounced around, but stays within the stream. Controlling light in this way gives up the ability to send information MUCH faster, as opposed to sending a postcard via snail mail!

Watch a soda can rip itself apart in a fiery explosion at 11,000fps with a Phantom high speed camera. Running a current through a coil, produces an electromagnet. Turn up the voltage in this experiment, and make that current strong enough, and your electromagnet can rip a soda can in half. Or rather, make the can rip itself in half! This video was filmed at Arc Attack Studios in Austin, TX with Joe Hanson, Joe DiPrima, John DiPrima and Darren Dyk.

How the quarter shrinking demo works: 
A coil of wire is wrapped around the quarter so it follows the edge of the quarter. Then a capacitor - kind of like a battery - is charged until it’s at a VERY high-voltage, which is then discharged through the wire. The current produced is high enough to make you go bye bye. The coil becomes an electromagnet - because current —≥ magnetic field  But this magnetic field creates another current or set of currents in the quarter - because changing magnetic field —≥ current in a circuit. But moving charges, i.e. currents, in a magnetic field will feel a force. For the quarter, the charges moving in the edge are feeling a force inward. The current was SO strong that the quarter PULLED ITSELF inward! This is madness.

In the press conference heard round the world, they showed the tell-tale waveforms indicating that huge event in which two black holes merged 1.3 billion lightyears away, had created waves that passed by the LIGO detectors and were finally heard. Einstein predicted the existence of these waves in his 1915 theory of general relativity. But it took a long time for us to come up with the technology to detect them. For one, we had to invent lasers! This video discusses why this discovery is important, what it means for astronomy, and what’s next.  If you can’t tell, I’m very excited.

957,hlRpl_GMPPc,Physics Girl,Are MRIs safe?,"Are there any dangers associated with receiving an MRI and how exactly does an MRI work? Is it safe? Medical imaging, specifically magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has come so far that we can create high resolution images of the entire body. The technology utilizes a cylindrical cavity surrounded by a giant electromagnet, and the magnetic field though the cavity is used to image body tissue.

1020,058hRtaCWC0,Veritasium,Why Robots That Bend Are Better,"Robots of the future may be softer, squishier and bendier than robots today. This could make them ideal for space exploration. Check out http://kiwico.com/Veritasium50 for 50% off your first month of any subscription!

On Thursday February 18th, 2021 the NASA Perseverance Rover will land on Mars. It is a wonderful robot, made out of steel and wire — but will future robots look like Perseverance? There is an emerging field of  research on ""soft robots"", where the machines are flexible. These soft robots have many advantages over traditional robots — they're safer, lighter, more flexible and can change their shape and size.

NASA is investigating the use of soft robots for space missions. For future visits to Enceladus or Europa, a lander could cut a hole in the ice and then insert a compliant robot through the hole. This robot could then grow and change shape on the other side.

Thanks to Google for sponsoring this video! Learn more about Search here: https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/

Special thanks to J.M.E.H van Bronswijk, author of 'House Dust Biology'. We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash:

- Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scales
This is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors.
The 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin).
You can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building.
However, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate.

- 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scales
It depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger.
For mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles.

- larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, synthetics
That's true .. including bread crumbs ..... 🙂

- skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed.
..... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming.
It has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours.

- skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc.
Yes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales.
However, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites.

Pavol Dobryakov turbulent simulations: https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/

I got into turbulent flow via chaos. The transition to turbulence sometimes involves a period doubling. Turbulence itself is chaotic motion, it is unpredictable and sensitively dependent on initial conditions. What surprised me is all the ways turbulent flow is useful to us. It is diffusive, meaning it causes mixing. This is useful in jet engines or rocket nozzles (which Destin studies) and is important to achieve in microfluidic devices, which are so small that turbulent flow is actually difficult to achieve. Turbulent flow can energize a boundary layer, which is important to maintain flow attachment over a wing, maintaining lift and delaying stall. Similarly a turbulent boundary layer over a golf ball reduces pressure drag allowing golf balls to fly further. This is the reason for the dimples on golf balls. Flow transitioning to turbulence in the wake of a bluff body can create periodic vortex shedding. This beautiful phenomenon can be seen in the von Kàrmàn vortex street in clouds viewed from space. Turbulence is everywhere, in the air currents in a room, in your aorta, in the breaths you exhale, in oil pipelines and water pipes, in the flow over cars and ships and planes. Animals have evolved for it (like dead fish swimming up stream) and we have engineered our environment, our planes and golf balls for it. Laminar flow may be nice to look at (which is why we use it in decorative fountains) but turbulent flow does the real lifting.

His book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'

Code for solving the Schrödinger equation by Jonny Hyman available here: https://github.com/jonnyhyman/QuantumWaves

I learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.

In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.

Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLP

What causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. 

To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.

Reversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.

I have long wanted to make a video about chaos, ever since reading James Gleick's fantastic book, Chaos. I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.

On first glance it's surprising that origami -- a centuries old art of folding paper to achieve particular aesthetics -- is applicable to engineering. But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.

Below is a further discussion by Henry Reich that I think helps summarize why axes 1 and 3 are generally stable while axis 2 is not:

In general, you might imagine that because the object can rotate in a bunch of different directions, the components of energy and momentum could be free to change while keeping the total momentum constant.

However, in the case of axis 1, the kinetic energy is the highest possible for a given angular momentum, and in the case of axis 3, the kinetic energy is the lowest possible for a given angular momentum (which can be easily shown from conservation of energy and momentum equations, and is also fairly intuitive from the fact that kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared, while momentum is proportional to velocity - so in the case of axis 1, the smaller masses will have to be spinning faster for a given momentum, and will thus have more energy, and vice versa for axis 3 where all the masses are spinning: the energy will be lowest). In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.

Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.","['veritasium', 'intermediate axis', 'tennis racket', 'theorem', 'flip', 'spinning', 'space', 'handle', 'rotating', 'rotation', 'axis', 'lastpass', 'lastpass login', 'password', 'password generator', 'lastpass chrome', 'lastpass download', 'lastpass premium', 'random password generator', 'generate password', 'password manager', 'recover', 'lastpas', 'laspass', 'lastpass premium features', 'delete account mobogram', 'lastpass.com', 'how secure is my password', 'last password']",2019-09-19T15:50:15Z,10411661,290187,0,18640,PT14M49S,hd,true

Huge thanks to:

I had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.

Making liquid nitrogen is hard - in fact up until 150 years ago scientists doubted whether it was even possible to liquefy nitrogen. In 1823, At the royal institution in London, Michael Faraday first produced liquid chlorine, kind of accidentally by putting it under high pressure. He similarly liquefied ammonia.

Borrowing a mixture from Thilorier in France, a combination of dry ice, snow and ether, he reached a temperature of -110C. By 1845 he used this mixture plus a hand pump to pressurize gases to liquefy all the known gases except six, which included oxygen and nitrogen. These became known as the “permanent” gases.

A French Physicist Aimé compressed oxygen and nitrogen in tanks and then lowered them into the ocean over 1.6km deep, where the pressure got up to 200 atmospheres. Still the gases didn’t liquefy.

Only at the end of 1877 were the first droplets of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced, by Cailletet in France. He first tried oxygen by compressing it up to 300 atmospheres, cooled to -30C, but that wasn't even enough to liquefy oxygen. But when he suddenly released the pressure, the expanding gas cooled, he estimated to -200C and he saw a mist and then droplets slide down the walls of his vessel.

It's amazing how far we've come in that now I can purchase a helium-based cryocooler. It compresses and expands the gas to absorb heat from the tip of the cold finger and eject it into the surroundings at ambient temperature.","['veritasium', 'liquid nitrogen', 'nitrogen', 'how to', 'ln2', 'lini', 'make', 'cryocooler', 'nitrogen membrane', 'liquid air', 'cold', 'cryogenic']",2019-08-16T17:06:32Z,7130051,93551,0,5450,PT13M43S,hd,true
1049,GhsZUZmJvaM,Veritasium,Mars Helicopter (before it went to Mars),"The Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity aims to make the first powered flight on another planet when it takes off on Mars. It has now landed and safely checked in with the rover. It should detach and fly within the first 30-60 days of the mission. I learned a lot getting to visit the drone right before it was mounted on the rover at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

How do you fly in 1% of Earth's atmosphere:
Have large rotors (they are 1.2m in diameter) and spin them very fast, around 2500 RPM (5x the speed of a helicopter on Earth).

Plus the aircraft has to be light:
The Mars helicopter weighs in at 1.8kg or around the same as a laptop. Every piece had to be stripped down for weight. Instead of using aerogel for insulation, the craft makes use of CO2 gaps between components. Even aerogel was too heavy!

One of the major challenges is surviving the Martian night:
Temperatures plunge to -80C to -100C so two thirds of the craft's power is actually used to keep its electronics warm. Only one third is used for flying. The estimated flight time is 90 seconds.

The craft can't be driven remotely, it will have to fly autonomously, using its own sensor suite to determine how to fly. The round trip 20 minute delay with Earth means steering the craft from mission control would be impossible.

Full disclosure: I drive an #electric #car. I think electric cars are the future, not mainly because they're better for the environment (which they are if you drive the car for any reasonable length of time) but because they are just better cars. The have better torque and acceleration, better handling, they're more efficient, quieter, they don't smell, they're cheaper to run and best of all you never have to visit a gas station - this appeals to me. I never have to worry about being low on gas because every morning my car is charged and ready to go - just like my phone and laptop. And if you're worried about range, don't. Almost all trips can already be done in an electric car with modest battery pack. And fast chargers along the way make it possible to do longer road trips if necessary. You have to make rest stops anyway, just time them with the charging. And consider that battery tech is getting dramatically cheaper, smaller, lighter. All these reasons are why I see the #future of cars as electric.

I found this story fascinating because in a way a nuclear bomb crater is more like a meteorite impact site than an impact site itself. Consider: Barringer Crater was claimed to be a meteorite impact site but geologists dismissed it as a volcanic formation. It was only after studying nuclear bomb craters and the minerals found there that geologists concluded the energy and pressures that created Barringer Crater were too high to be from volcanic activity and therefore must have formed from a meteorite impact.

Aerogel’s extraordinary properties are due in large part to its structure. Aerogel is a solid but on the nanoscale it has a mesh or sponge-like structure. The struts of this structure are nanoscale, as are the pores at around 20nm across. This makes silica aerogel incredibly light (it was once the lightest solid but has now been superseded by graphene aerogel), transparent and adsorbent. 

An ice-cube sized piece of aerogel has an internal surface area roughly equal to half a football field. Aerogel is used in high end museum cases to regulate humidity. Plus it helps maintain the vacuum on the Mars Insight seismometers - it adsorbs moisture and other outgassed volatiles that come from the spacecraft itself. Proposed uses include as a physical insecticide by ‘drying out insects’ reducing the need for chemical and toxic pesticides.

1054,BZbChKzedEk,Veritasium,Can You Swim in Shade Balls?,"I bought 10,000 shade balls and tried to swim in them. They appear to act like a non-Newtonian fluid: rigid under high shear stress, but they flow like a liquid under low shear.
All the signed shade balls have now been mailed out - thanks for your support!

Receiving a shade ball:

2. In about a month I will send out signed shade balls
3. I will cover all shipping costs but if things get really crazy I will prioritize existing Patreon supporters and higher tiers

My sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them. But a little bit of motion causes them to move around and you sink through quickly.

So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content.

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.

Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!

The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.

Applications open June 1: http://bit.ly/2HkLXT1 This video was sponsored by Regeneron. The Science Talent Search was founded and produced by the Society for Science and the Public.

Huge thanks to the students: Ronak Roy, Ana Humphrey, and Anjali Chadha. It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.

Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.

Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.

Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.

Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.

1061,zUyH3XhpLTo,Veritasium,How to Understand the Black Hole Image,"We have just seen the first image of a black hole, the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87 with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our sun. But what is that image really showing us?

This is an awesome paper on the topic by J.P. Luminet:
Image of a spherical black hole with thin accretion disk
Astronomy and Astrophysics, vol. 75, no. 1-2, May 1979, p. 228-235
https://ve42.co/luminet

Using my every day intuition I wondered: will we see the ""shadow"" of the black hole even if we're looking edge on at the accretion disk? The answer is yes because the black hole warps space-time, so even if we wouldn't normally be able to see the back of the accretion disk, we can in this case because its light is bent up and over the black hole. Similarly we can see light from the bottom of the back of the accretion disk because it's bent under the bottom of the black hole. Plus there are additional images from light that does a half turn around the black hole leading to the inner rings.

What about the black hole ""shadow"" itself? Well initially I thought it can't be an image of the event horizon because it's so much bigger (2.6 times bigger). But if you trace back the rays, you find that for every point in the shadow, there is a corresponding ray that traces back to the event horizon. So in fact from our one observing location, we see all sides of the event horizon simultaneously! In fact infinitely many of these images, accounting for the virtually infinite number of times a photon can orbit the black hole before falling in. The edge of the shadow is due to the photon sphere - the radius at which light goes around in closed orbits. If a light ray coming in at an oblique angle just skims the photon sphere and then travels on to our telescopes, that is the closest 'impact parameter' possible, and it occurs at sqrt(27)/2*r_s

This is a video I've long wanted to make, about what makes video look like video and, up until 10 years ago or so, not as appealing as film. I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.

2. Productions processes (many, new, different enabled by compliant designs)
3. Price (reduced by fewer parts and different production processes)
4. Precise Motion (no backlash, less wear, friction)
5. Performance (no outgassing, doesn't require lubricant)
6. Proportions (reduced through different production processes)
7. Portability (lightweight due to simpler, reduced part count designs)

Part of this video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2SmRQkk
Special thanks to Dr. Abe Davis for revisiting his research with me: http://abedavis.com

This video was based on research by Dr. Abe Davis and colleagues. I found out about this work years ago and was fascinated by the way he was able to capture vibration information in image-only video. I always imagined the motions of objects would be visible as when recording a tuning fork in slow motion - so deriving sound from high speed images seemed a feasible task. But the reality is much more difficult.

Sound vibrations only cause objects to wiggle by about a micrometer. This is much smaller than a pixel, so the algorithm must understand the characteristics of the image. A move in one direction should cause some pixels to lighten slightly, while others darken - and this behavior is correlated along the edges of the image. So noise can be reduced because it's random over the image and there are enough places to sample that you can get it to cancel out.

Something I'm wondering now is - would it be possible to capture sound in a single image? I'm thinking it would have to be an image of a large object or space because the wavelengths of typical sounds are quite long. Maybe a high frequency sound could be imaged in a suitable medium...

A grape is the right size and refractive index to trap microwaves inside it. When you place two (or two halves) close together the fields interact with each other creating a maximum of electromagnetic energy where they touch. This creates heating, sparks, and plasma, which is further fed with energy directly by the microwaves.

Human brains are complicated - the most complicated thing in the known universe, many people say. So far we understand little - just that certain regions of the brain appear to be involved in certain activities and certain disorders. In extreme cases this has led to the practice of removing sections of the brain, or using electrodes or optical fibers to control activation rates. What is unique about this approach is it offers a way to turn on and off specific brain regions without invasive surgery. It has promise because it combines existing technologies: micro-bubbles, ultrasound, synthetic viruses, and synthetic drugs to achieve this goal.

Will this be the last video I make about SI units? Quite possibly. There's something about being so precise and defining the systems within which science works. When we can more accurately and routinely measure a kilogram, a mole, a kelvin and an ampere, then we can make better observations, we can better detect anomalies and improve our theories. That is why this is so important to me.

Check out Mars on National Geographic, Monday Nov 12 at 9/8c
#sponsored

When I got offered the chance to fly in another #zeroG plane, I jumped at the chance. Do you know how hard it is when you are thrust into low-gravity, like the 37% of Earth's gravity of Mars, and you have to remember what you were going to say in a 30 second window as blood floods your head? It's pretty hard. It would be even harder to actually travel to Mars. It would take about 8 months in microgravity during which time your muscles and bones would weaken substantially, even if you exercise for hours a day like the astronauts on the space station. And your heart is a muscle too so it weakens as well. Before I contemplated these rates of muscle and bone loss, I thought the major challenge with a round trip journey to Mars would be the logistics of spacecraft and having enough fuel to get back. But with the weakening of the human body, it's an open question whether anyone would really want to come back.

Check out Head & Shoulders research on getting rid of dandruff: https://ve42.co/HS

Animation by Pindex: https://ve42.co/pindex

When I started this project, I wasn't sure what caused dandruff and I also didn't think much science would go into making a shampoo like Head & Shoulders. So what I learned really surprised me:

There are hundreds of scientists working on this shampoo. They run crazy-sounding experiments like hanging hair near Tokyo highways to understand how real-world environments deposit dirt on hair. They use sophisticated scientific techniques like electron microscopes, nuclear magnetic resonance and gene sequencing to study dandruff on the molecular level.

In fact they sequenced the entire genome of Malassezia globosa in 2002, one year after the human genome project. Their findings are published in international refereed journals. What they have found is that the Malassezia fungi create free fatty acids as byproducts of their digestion, which for some people create irritation and lead to hyper-proliferation of skin cells, flaking, histamines, inflammatory cytokines, and blood proteins reaching the surface of the skin. These findings indicate the unhealthiness of dandruff scalp and suggest a possible remedy - controlling the metabolism of the Malassezia fungi. This is achieved using different active ingredients in different products and different parts of the world, including zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, and piroctone olamine. With the reduction of irritants, the scalp actually expresses different genes, producing a signature more similar to a non-dandruff baseline scalp.

This video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2wAsdUu

I feel like this video might come across as condescending but the person I'm really talking to is myself. Despite the fact that I know how useful it can be to be bored, I still find myself trying to fill every last moment with stimulus. Boredom is unpleasant - the open, unstructured thinking that can take place can also feel pointless. But now I'm made this video to remind myself how important boredom is so hopefully I'll make more time to be bored.

Ultraviolet light causes damage to DNA, leads to cancer and photoaging: age spots and wrinkles. I was curious about this because UV is technically non-ionizing. A photon of UV doesn't have enough energy to strip an electron off atoms or molecules. However it does have enough energy to trigger photo-chemical reactions. For example, it causes pyrimidine dimers - the unauthorized covalent bonding of adjacent thymine or cytosine bases in our DNA. If these spots are not properly repaired, they may lead to mutations and cancer. Photoaging is typically the result of degradation of collagen and elastin fibers - scaffolding that supports the skin. This leads to wrinkles and saggy-looking skin.

Watch my new documentary, VITAMANIA: http://ve42.co/vita

I came across this story as I was making the film Vitamania. When you ask sellers of vitamins why you should take vitamin supplements even if you eat a healthy diet, they will say because our food doesn't contain all the nutrients it once did. This is supposedly due to soil depletion, cold storage, food ripening off the vine, and global transport of out-of-season foods. And to an extent this is true. Foods contain the greatest amount of nutrients if they are eaten soon after they are harvested. An unexpected source of nutrient decline is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It causes plants to grow faster and bulk up on carbs but at the expense of other nutrients, so in percentage terms the amount of nutrients are actually declining. For now this decline is modest so supplementing with vitamin pills is probably unnecessary for most people with a healthy diet but it may be a concern in future.

In summary, ultraviolet light interacts differently with matter for a number of reasons:
1. Some pigments selectively absorb UV so they may appear white in the visible but dark in the UV. The pigments usually dissipate the UV energy as heat, though the breaking of bonds can also occur.
2. Fluorescent molecules absorb UV light and re-radiate that energy as visible light. This makes them look dark in the UV but glowing under black light.
3. Ultraviolet light scatters more than visible light because the wavelength is shorter and Raleigh scattering is proportional to the reciprocal of wavelength to the power of four.

I learned a lot in making this video and the one on my second channel with Prof. Jon Arnou. I changed a lot of my preconceptions, specifically I thought:

1. That the Earth's magnetic field was a passive thing - it shouldn't need a continuous input of energy to maintain itself (that seemed reasonable to me because the magnetic field has been around for a long time and it seems mostly stable). But as it turns out, the Earth is a giant electromagnet, and so of course those currents dissipate their energy as they encounter resistance in the liquid metal through which they flow. So the energy to continuously create these currents comes from the kinetic energy of the liquid metal flows in the Earth's outer core.

2. If it's convection, I'm thinking hot things rising, cooler things falling. But apparently the main effect driving convection is the compositional differences at the boundary with the Earth's inner core. This is because of the differential freezing at the boundary. Things like iron freeze into the inner core, while elements like sulfur do not. Hence the pockets of lighter material which then rise outwards.

3. I didn't get why the fluid motion was necessary for the generation of the magnetic field. I mean if it's a conducting liquid, it can conduct currents whether it moves or not. But the key is that the liquid metal can 'trap' magnetic fields. I imagine this like how iron channels magnetic fields. Then once these fields are channeled, they can be pulled and stretched, making more magnetic field.

4. Fluids operate very differently in rotating frames of reference. This is something I didn't intuitively grasp. But, as fluids move from the inner core outwards, those particles are moving much more slowly in the direction of rotation than the matter that has been there for a long time, which means the convection currents get deflected and form helices.

I hope I've articulated everything clearly in this video. If not, I'll clarify in comments. Thanks to everyone who appears in this video and thanks to everyone who watches this video!

Veritasium is of course a combination of the latin 'veritas' meaning truth, and the common element ending 'ium'. I guess this is my version of the 'draw my life' craze that rolled through YouTube many years ago. Except I wanted to tell my story with the actual moments, the photons, the stored magnetic states. There's something about that which is so important to me (because I think the alternative involves fooling yourself) which is why I'm so fascinated by film and video.

One of my inspirations for the name Veritasium came from the end of the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats, in which he writes:
 ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all

A few years ago I made a documentary about uranium, radioactivity and radiation. I always thought of the characters in our story as the scientists and maybe the uranium nucleus itself. It was only through making the documentary that I realized the real hero of the story is the neutron. Without a neutral nuclear particle, it would be virtually impossible to release the energy from the nucleus. But with it, and the idea of a chain reaction, nuclear energy went from science fiction to reality. That is something I had not grasped as clearly before and it motivated me to make this video.

What I do think is more predictable is the development of autonomous weapons that use AI to be the most effective killing machines of all time. That is scary.

Exercising, higher metabolism, higher body temperature, more body odor, being pregnant, type O blood, infrequent bathing, lactic acid, ammonia, acetone.

There are a number of folk remedies people believe protect them from mosquito bites like drinking alcohol, eating garlic, or taking vitamin B. These do not appear to provide any benefit in lab studies and in fact drinking alcohol is associated with increased mosquito activity because it causes blood vessels near the surface of the skin to dilate.

And apparently some of your attractiveness to mosquitos is simply genetic. This may be mediated through your immune system, which is what a lot of the genes identified were associated with.

Check out the series on new safety features: http://ve42.co/MB
This video is sponsored by Mercedes-Benz, who invited me to come to Stuttgart to see their latest cars, crash test facilities and experience the innovations they are working on.

Physics is something that is directly applicable to car safety. Cars go fast, but they also sometimes collide with obstacles, which brings them to a sudden stop, subjecting the car and occupants to very high accelerations, which can cause injury or death. So the major idea to improve car safety is to reduce these accelerations and there are a number of ways to do this:

Passive safety:

Seat belts: keep passengers in the vehicle, preventing them from continuing with constant velocity, flying through the windshield and suffering a worse deceleration when they make contact with the road.

Crumple zones: increase the distance over which deceleration occurs, thereby reducing peak magnitude of deceleration.

Air bags: increase the distance over which the head decelerates, again reducing peak magnitude of deceleration of the head.

Active Safety:
Anti-lock braking system: rather than 'locking' the wheels as can happen if you slam on the brakes with a traditional braking system leading to the tires skidding across the road, ABS attempts to control the amount of braking so that the tires always roll with static friction in contact with the road. This increases the backward frictional force that can be applied to the tires, again increasing the distance over which deceleration occurs, and it gives the driver an opportunity to steer to avoid the collision (hence why it's referred to as an active safety system).

Every day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.

To make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.

And cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.

This is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.

Now the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.
It literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.
So it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.

To prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.
These nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.
You can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.

The process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.
As simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.
The kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.
While the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide
The kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.
At this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.

Virgo Helps Localize Gravitational-Wave Signals
Sky localizations of gravitational-wave signals detected by LIGO beginning in 2015 (GW150914, LVT151012, GW151226, GW170104), and, more recently, by the LIGO-Virgo network (GW170814, GW170817). After Virgo came online in August 2017, scientists were better able to localize the gravitational-wave signals. The background is an optical image of the Milky Way. The localizations of GW150914, LVT151012, and GW170104 wrap around the celestial sphere, so the sky map is shown with a translucent dome.

I have been obsessed with measurement for a long time and I'm not sure quite how it happened. The world's roundest object played a role in this. I guess I'm just fascinated by how difficult it is to pin down a quantity like a kilogram. A physical object seemed like a good idea until the mass of the international prototype kilogram wasn't as constant as expected. These methods of the Kibble balance and silicon sphere have shown better precision than 20 parts per billion, making them superior to the old method. The agreement between Avogadro approaches

Want to make this at home? https://youtu.be/BppcHF2EdAY

My friend Blake from InnoVinci emailed me with a cool idea for a video and footage of levitating balls in water streams. Initially it was tough to explain the physics of what was going on. The standard Bernoulli effect relies on the object being completely immersed in the upward-flowing fluid. But in this case the water seems to form a single stream around the object and it's deflected away and down from the stream. By Newton's third law, the force on the water by the ball is equal and opposite to the force of the water back on the ball, pushing it up into the stream. There is a stable equilibrium position because if the ball moves into the stream, it ""cuts off"" the water going over the ball so it drifts out. If it drifts out too far, then lots of water passes over the ball, pushing it back into the stream.

I first saw a Schlieren imaging setup around ten years ago in Melbourne. I was immediately fascinated by the way I could see the warm air coming off my hand. I hadn't expected the currents to be moving that fast or to be so visible. This was a tricky setup to get right because alignment is very important and here I'm just working with what I had lying around the house mostly (plus the mirror). For the best Schlieren photography, making sure the mirror is stable is essential. I want to improve my setup so the mirror doesn't wobble back and forth too much creating the pulsing light and dark sections of this video.

The intensity of sunlight on Earth is about 1300 Watts per square meter. When you focus the sun's rays using a magnifying glass (or in this case sphere of water) you can increase the intensity roughly ten thousand fold. This increases the temperature of wood to its autoignition point starting the reaction with oxygen in the atmosphere. By protecting the hot embers and adding more energy and fuel, you can get these hot coals to start a roaring fire.

Before visiting NIST in Washington DC I had no idea machines like this existed. Surely there's an accurate way to measure forces without creating such a huge known force?! Nope. This appears to be the best way, with a stack of 20 x 50,000 lb masses creating a maximum force of 4.45 MN or 1,000,000 pounds of force. I also wouldn't have thought about all the corrections that need applying - for example buoyancy subtracts about 125 pounds from the weight of the stack. Plus the local gravitational field strength must be taken into account. And, the gravitational field varies below grade. All of this must be taken into account in order to limit uncertainty to just five parts per million (.0005%)

Back in 1875 The US signed the Metre Convention, which basically committed the country to use the metric system. In return, French scientists sent two platinum-iridium cylinders that weigh 1kg to the US in 1889 (known by their designations K4 and K20 from a set of 40 identical objects that were produced and sent around the world). So even though everything you see and buy in the US is usually reported in pounds, all weights are traceable back to the K20 kilogram (by applying a conversion factor to get to pounds).

When I was in DC a few weeks ago, I visited the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and got up close with K20, which is still kept there and used to calibrate all mass standards in this country. I thought it was pretty cool.

The zero-g plane allows for a lot of experiments to be conducted without the expense of getting equipment into orbit. Apparently 80% of microgravity research can be performed in a zero-gravity plane, which is much cheaper than going to space. The flame from the lighter seemed much lazier in zero-g because without weight there is no buoyant force and therefore no convection. This makes the process of combustion more challenging because it's difficult for oxygen to reach the fuel.

It's also not clear exactly how this affects physiology or causes the sun sneeze but there is correlative evidence that every copy of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with a 1.3x increase in likelihood of having the photic sneeze reflex.

I have wanted to make a video about sun-sneezing for a long time. It is something I've experienced my whole life. When I go from a dark room indoors into full sunlight I invariably sneeze. I thought everyone did it. So my original question was why do people sneeze when they see bright light? That led me to consider what possible evolutionary advantages there could be to sneezing in sunlight. The obvious advantage to me is that sunlight kills pathogens of which there may be many in your snot or mucus. So sneezing in sunshine is a much better idea than sneezing inside a dark, damp cave where you may be living.

1. A half-full container of honey does pretty well in reproducing the behaviour of the mystery cylinder. I wonder if the motion is a little smoother or more periodic with the ping-pong balls because they move as organized objects - also the delays between motion seemed to be longer with them than without ping pong balls.

2. For the average speed track problem, every time I said velocity I meant speed. Sorry to the pedants out there who are perhaps looking for some trick answer due to displacement being zero when you run around a track.

3. Although a lot of people identified it was something about a train's wheels that move backwards, fewer identified that specifically it was the part of the flange below the rail. Some simply said the bottom half of the wheel.

4. The bicycle question is perhaps the most complex of these riddles. If you tried it with a bike you likely found that it went backwards. But what happens if you sit on the bike and only push backwards on the bottom pedal.

I didn't say it explicitly in the video, but in my view the Bayesian trap is interpreting events that happen repeatedly as events that happen inevitably. They may be inevitable OR they may simply be the outcome of a series of steps, which likely depend on our behaviour. Yet our expectation of a certain outcome often leads us to behave just as we always have which only ensures that outcome. To escape the Bayesian trap, we must be willing to experiment.

The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes’ Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy, by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne

Bayes' theorem or rule (there are many different versions of the same concept) has fascinated me for a long time due to its uses both in mathematics and statistics, and to solve real world problems. Bayesian inference has been used to crack the Enigma Code and to filter spam email. Bayes has also been used to locate the wreckage from plane crashes deep beneath the sea.

Sync the videos yourself: http://toiletswirl.com

For the record Destin and I repeated the experiment 3-4 times each in each hemisphere and got the same results every time.

The idea that water going down a drain or flushed down a toilet swirls in opposite directions in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres has a long history. But few have ever done the experiment. Destin from Smarter Every Day and I performed identical experiments in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. What we found is the direction of water swirl in a toilet, sink, or bathtub is determined by other sources of angular momentum. However if the body of water is big enough, e.g. a kiddy pool, and left still for long enough (at least 24 hours), then the Coriolis effect is observable with water swirling counterclockwise in the Northern hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern hemisphere.

A lot of videos have covered the general overview of the discovery of gravitational waves, what they are, the history of the search, when they were found but I wanted to delve into the absurd science that made the detection possible.

When scientists want one megawatt of laser power, it's not just for fun (though I'm sure it's that too), it's because the fluctuations in the number of photons is proportional to their square root, making more powerful beams less noisy (as a fraction of their total). The smoothest mirrors were created not for aesthetic joy but because when you're trying to measure wiggles that are a fraction the width of a proton, a rough mirror surface simply won't do.

Lehrbuch der Chemie by Jöns Jakob Berzelius

Script:
As an Australian-Canadian the Fahrenheit temperature scale always seemsed a bit arbitrary. I mean why does water freeze at 32 degrees? And what exactly does zero represent?

According to many sources the Fahrenheit scale was defined by setting zero degrees equal to the temperature of an ice, salt, and water mixture and 100 degrees being roughly equal to human body temperature. But that isn’t true.

The real story is much more interesting, and scientific...

August 14th 1701 was almost certainly the worst day in the life of fifteen year-old Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. On that day both of his parents died suddenly from mushroom poisoning. He was sent from Poland, where he lived, to Amsterdam to become an apprentice bookkeeper.

But Fahrenheit couldn’t stand his apprenticeship and ran away so many times his employers put out a warrant for his arrest. Traveling from city to city around Europe, he became fascinated with scientific instruments and in particular thermometers.

In 1708, possibly seeking help with the warrant, Fahrenheit met with the mayor of Copenhagen, who happened to be the famous astronomer Ole Romer.

Romer is known for observing the eclipses of Jupiter’s moons and realizing that variations in the timing of those eclipses was caused by the time it took light to reach Earth. In other words, he found a way to accurately measure the finite speed of light.

But more pertinent to this story, in 1702 Romer was housebound after breaking his leg. To pass the time he devised a new temperature scale with the freezing point of water at 7.5 degrees and body temperature at 22.5 degrees.

This might seem odd until you consider that Romer wanted the boiling point of water to be 60 degrees (as an astronomer, he had experience dividing things by 60). If you take this scale, divide it in half, in half again, and in half once more, you find the freezing point of water 1/8th up the scale, and human body temperature 3/8th up the scale.

So at their meeting in 1708, Fahrenheit learned of Romer’s temperature scale and adopted it as his own, adjusting it slightly because he found it “inconvenient and inelegant on account of the fractional numbers”. So he scaled them up to 8 and 24.

That is the original Fahrenheit scale. He produced thermometers for some time using this scale.

But then, at some later time Fahrenheit multiplied all numbers on his scale by four, setting freezing point to the now familiar 32 and body temperature to 96. It’s unclear exactly why he did this. He may just have wanted finer precision in his measurements but I think there was a better reason.

You see, Fahrenheit was an excellent instrument maker. His thermometers agreed with each other precisely, at a time when that was unheard of. He pioneered the use of mercury as a measuring liquid, which has the benefit of a much higher boiling point than the alcohol used in most other thermometers at the time. For these accomplishments, he was inducted into the British Royal Society.

And we know he read the works of Newton, Boyle, and Hooke, in which he would have come across the idea that a one degree increase in temperature should correspond to a specific fractional increase in the volume of the measuring liquid.

And today a one degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature increases the volume of mercury by exactly one part in 10,000. Is this just a coincidence? We’ll probably never know for sure because as an instrument maker Fahrenheit was secretive about his methods. But I think the data strongly suggests this was the case.

So what exactly did zero represent on the scales of Fahrenheit and Romer? By many accounts it’s the temperature of a salt, ice and water mixture. But there are different descriptions of these mixtures and none of them actually produces the temperature they’re supposed to. More likely I think they picked the coldest temperature in winter, set that as zero and later used ice and brine to calibrate new thermometers. Now his scale is only used regularly in the Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Belize, oh and the United States of America.","['veritasium', 'science', 'fahrenheit', 'temperature', 'scale', 'celsius', 'degree', 'romer', 'thermometer', 'hot', 'cold', 'measurement', 'history', 'how']",2016-11-28T15:32:12Z,4967236,133900,0,11908,PT5M24S,hd,true

Thanks to Google Making and Science for helping me pursue my #sciencegoals. If you want to try this experiment, instructions are here: link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12650-016-0383-5

The standard theory of quantum mechanics leaves a bit to be desired. As Richard Feynman put it, ""I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics."" This is because observations of experiments have led us to a theory that contradicts common sense. The wave function contains all the information that is knowable about a particle, yet it can only be used to calculate probabilities of where a particle will likely turn up. It can't give us an actual account of where the particle went or where it will be at some later time.

Some have suggested that this theory is incomplete. Maybe something is going on beneath the radar of standard quantum theory and somehow producing the appearance of randomness and uncertainty without actually being random or uncertain. Theories of this sort are called hidden variable theories because they propose entities that aren't observable. One such theory is pilot wave theory, first proposed by de Broglie, but later developed by Bohm. The idea here is that a particle oscillates, creating a wave. It then interacts with the wave and this complex interaction determines its motion.

Experiments using silicone oil droplets on a vibrating bath provide a remarkable physical realization of pilot wave theories. They give us a physical picture of what the quantum world might look like if this is what's going on - and this theory is still deterministic. The particle is never in two places at once and there is no randomness.

Let's see how clearly I can explain this. We think of empty space as, well... empty, the epitome of nothingness. But as our understanding of physics has evolved we have realized that it's not truly empty. Space is filled with fields. There is a field for every subatomic particle. One for electrons, up quarks, down quarks, neutrinos and so on. In empty space these fields are basically zero, flat, nil. But it's impossible to make them perfectly zero so there are always some quantum fluctuations in the fields, even in a perfect vacuum. These are sometimes called virtual particles but they should really just be thought of as little disturbances in the field. Vacuum fluctuation play a role mediating the interactions of subatomic particles but they don't really have an impact on the large-scale structure of the universe, EXCEPT during inflation, right after the big bang when the universe increased in size 10^26 times. Due to this rapid expansion, those tiny fluctuations were blown up to the scale of the observable universe. And we know this by looking at the cosmic microwave background radiation where we can see slightly hotter and cooler parts of the early universe that correspond to density fluctuations. And it is these density fluctuations that allowed matter to clump together into large structures like the gigantic gas clouds that would go on to contain stars and planets. In case the video isn't clear, this is what I've been trying to say.

Virtual particles are a way of talking about fields and their interactions as though particles are doing all the work. This is why there is some controversy around using the term 'virtual particles'. Some people think the term is useful, especially since in calculating with Feynman diagrams you draw all the particle interactions that are possible (and then do the calculations to get the right answer). While others feel this terminology is misleading because virtual particles don't behave like real particles and can't be observed.","['veritasium', 'science', 'physics', 'virtual particles', 'quantum fluctuations', 'lamb shift', 'lamb effect', 'prediction', 'best', 'worst', 'hydrogen', 'spectrum', 'quantum field theory', 'dark energy', 'expansion of the universe', 'energy', 'atoms', 'particles', 'fields', 'uncertainty principle', 'quantum', 'field', 'virtual', 'vacuum']",2016-09-08T14:00:02Z,2696551,69611,0,3631,PT8M43S,hd,true

Come take a walk with me around Longyearbyen, the largest town on the Norwegian islands of Svalbard.

Parts of it look familiar, but make no mistake, this place is different.

At 78 degrees North, it lies just 800 miles or 1300 kilometres from the North Pole. And with over 2,000 permanent inhabitants it is the Northernmost real town on Earth.

There are only 50km of road, including the small streets between houses, so people get around the island mainly on snowmobile.

In fact there are more registered snowmobiles than residents.

Anyone leaving town is required to travel with a gun and someone who knows how to use it because the islands are also home to polar bears.

The average daytime high is below freezing for all but four months of the year, and from the end of October to mid-February the sun doesn’t rise at all. This is the long polar night.

Living here is tough. This past December an avalanche in town destroyed 10 homes, which used to be here, killing two people.

So how did this cold, remote, ice-covered archipelago come to be inhabited?

The hills around town are rich in coal deposits that have been mined for over 100 years.

The coal was transported to the port via a series of aerial tramways some of which remain today, though they are no longer operational.

Coal is a reminder that Svalbard was not always an Arctic ice world. 360 million years ago it was actually in the tropics North of the equator. A swampy area, it was covered with the precursors to modern ferns, which were much larger than they are today, reaching 10-30 metres in height.

This vegetation was then covered in mud and sand and submerged under the sea. Over time it turned into the coal deposits that in the 20th century brought miners from Norway, Russia, and the US.

Most of the coal mines have now closed and the economy is gradually shifting towards tourism, education and research.

Tourists take trips on snowmobiles and dog sleds.

There is a university centre in Svalbard, which offers semester courses in biology, physics and geology.

And up on the side of a mountain is the Svalbard Global seed vault… but that’s a story for another time.

The locals tell me that interest in the region from different nations is increasing.

As the globe warms and Arctic ice shrinks, trade routes are opening up across the North. And Svalbard is strategically placed between North America, Asia and Europe.

One day in the future Svalbard may no longer be as cold or remote as it once was.

But for now it is a reminder of how through our ingenuity people can live in the most inhospitable of places.

Gordon McGladdery did all of the sound design for the video. We used two songs from other artists (licensed of course). Derek split the first one up so it fades from video to video, and Gordon split the instruments up on the second one. There are violins on one video and percussion on the other for example. It's really neat.

The neat earth animation at the beginning and the synchronizing timer was made by http://eisenfeuer.com/. He also made still images of the earth from the top and the bottom.

What is NOT random? http://bit.ly/NOTrandoVe
First, I know this video is not easy to understand. Thank you for taking the time to attempt to understand it. I've been working on this for over six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with two of them).

Does hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden variables must update faster than light - they would be considered 'non-local'. On the other hand if you don't consider the spins before you make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don't exist and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be conserved in the universe.

Everyone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability of up/down.

Psychological literature shows that we are more sensitive to small losses and than small gains, with most people valuing a loss around 1.5-2.5 times as much as a gain. This means that we often turn down reasonable opportunities for fear of the loss. However over the course of our lives we will be exposed to many risks and opportunities and this invariably means that taking every small reasonable bet will leave us better off than saying no to all of them.

NOTE: The video is not saying to accept every bet, only those with reasonable odds (preferably in your favour), and those which if you lose would not cause significant financial or other damage. In those cases it is wise to be loss averse!

Check out Audible: http://bit.ly/AudibleVe
I'm filming a documentary for TV about how Uranium and radioactivity have shaped the modern world. It will be broadcast in mid-2015, details to come. The filming took me to the most radioactive places on Earth (and some places, which surprisingly aren't as radioactive as you'd think). Chernobyl and Fukushima were incredible to see as they present post-apocalyptic landscapes. I also visited nuclear power plants, research reactors, Marie Curie's institute, Einstein's apartment, nuclear medicine areas of hospitals, uranium mines, nuclear bomb sites, and interviewed numerous experts.

Notes about measuring radiation:
Sieverts are a measure of 'effective dose' - that means they measure the biological impact of the energy transferred to tissues from radiation.

Obviously I owe a debt to the fantastic chart made by xkcd, which inspired my visual approach to this video.
https://xkcd.com/radiation/

DOSES MAY VARY
The level of radiation varies widely around the world depending mainly on altitude and geology (excluding nuclear accidents).

Estimates of particular doses also vary. All numbers reported in this video should be taken as order of magnitude only.

The most contentious claim may be that smokers receive the highest dose of ionizing radiation. This is not a whole body dose, but a dose to the lungs as specified in the video. References are here:

These ideas have been percolating since I wrote my PhD in physics education: https://ve42.co/phd
I have also discussed this topic with CGP Grey, whose view of the future of education differs significantly from mine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsCAM17O-M

I think it is instructive that each new technology has appeared to be so transformative. You can imagine, for example, that motion pictures must have seemed like a revolutionary learning technology. After all they did revolutionize entertainment, yet failed to make significant inroads into the classroom. TV and video seem like a cheaper, scaled back film, but they too failed to live up to expectations. Now there is a glut of information and video on the internet so should we expect it to revolutionize education?

My view is that it won't, for two reasons: 1. Technology is not inherently superior, animations over static graphics, videoed presentations over live lectures etc. and 2. Learning is inherently a social activity, motivated and encouraged by interactions with others.

Check out Audible: http://bit.ly/AudibleVe
Live show in Alabama: http://bit.ly/VeRAOI

The most common misconception about the pyramids is that they were built by slaves. Recent archeological evidence suggests they were instead constructed by paid workers. Some may have performed this work as a form of tax payment for several months of the year. Skilled engineers would have planned and orchestrated the building. An estimated 10,000-20,000 people would have been working on a pyramid at any one point in time. They were well fed and provided with shelter near the pyramids. Plus their burial sites close by indicate they were respected and were not slaves.

Much of the limestone was quarried from the Giza plateau itself, meaning the stones did not need to be transported far. The granite casing of Menkaure's pyramid, on the other hand, was transported from Aswan, around 600 miles, or 1000 km up the Nile.

When a female embryo is four days old it consists of just 100 cells. At this point the x-chromosome from Mom and the one from Dad are both active. But in order for proper development to occur, one of the x chromosomes must be switched off.

Through a tiny molecular battle within each cell, one of the x-chromosomes wins and remains active while the loser is deactivated.

This is done by wrapping the DNA tighter around proteins, modifying histone tails, and DNA methylation - molecular markers to indicate this DNA should not be read.

What's surprising is that it's pretty random which x chromosome wins - sometimes it's Mom's and sometimes it's Dad's. So when a female is just 100 cells big, her cells have a mix of active x-chromosomes, some from Mom and some from Dad.","['veritasium', 'epigenetics', 'chromosome', 'chromosomes', 'inactivation', 'genome', 'x-chromosome', 'genetics', 'biology', 'calico cats', 'calico cat', 'dna', 'mRNA', 'histones', 'Female (Gender)']",2014-06-04T15:00:07Z,8142443,206258,0,13971,PT5M17S,hd,true

Thanks to Prof. Geraint Lewis for input on earlier drafts of this video.

The expanding universe is a complicated place. During inflation the universe expanded faster than light, but that's something that actually happens all the time, it's happening right now. This doesn't violate Einstein's theory of relativity since nothing is moving through space faster than light, it's just that space itself is expanding such that far away objects are receding rapidly from each other.

This is because light can travel from regions of space which are superluminal relative to us into regions that are subluminal.

In this experiment we see that a golf ball is denser than detergent (it is also denser than pure water incidentally, which is why water hazards are so effective at ruining a golfer's day on the course). But, a golf ball is less dense than a saturated salt solution. Now the question is: if you pour the detergent on top of the golf ball in the salt solution, what will happen to the golf ball?

Rubens' Tube is an awesome demo and here we take it to the next level with a two-dimensional 'Pyro Board'. This shows unique standing wave patters of sound in the box.

The pressure variations due to the sound waves affect the flow rate of flammable gas from the holes in the Pyro Board and therefore affect the height and colour of flames. This is interesting for visualizing standing wave patterns and simply awesome to watch when put to music. Thank you to Sune Nielsen and everyone at Aarhus for sharing this demonstration with me!

1169,-zShHRkwSoI,Veritasium,Why Trees Are Taller Than They Need To Be,"A forest is like a meadow on useless stilts.
Most amazing thing about trees: http://bit.ly/TFilQ8

We often imagine that unregulated competition produces optimal outcomes, behaviours, efficiencies, but trees and baggage carousels are two examples where the stable solution is worse for everyone than another strategy. This I find surprising and interesting - that evolution doesn't come to the best solution, it comes to the most stable one.

The Forest of Friendship was a concept I first came across in Richard Dawkin's book ""The Greatest Show on Earth."" One point I'd like to clarify is that being taller comes with a cost - having a longer trunk requires costly expenditure of energy. However, in a forest of uniformly short trees, being a little taller conveys an advantage. That is until all the other trees catch up, at which time the extra height no longer provides a benefit. So over time as the whole forest rises up the conditions are getting worse for each tree, but they are powerless to stop the evolutionary arms race.

How do you investigate hypotheses? Do you seek to confirm your theory - looking for white swans? Or do you try to find black swans? I was startled at how hard it was for people to investigate number sets that didn't follow their hypotheses, even when their method wasn't getting them anywhere.

In the video I say ""when people came to Australia..."" by which I meant, ""when Europeans who believed all swans were white came to Australia..."" I did not mean any offence to Indigenous Australians who were already in Australia at that time. Please accept my apologies for the poor phrasing if you were offended by it.

This video was inspired by The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb and filmed by my mum. Thanks mum!

Partly my motivation came from responses to my Facebook videos - social media marketers saying 'Facebook ads have worked for me so there can't be fake likes.' Just because you have only seen white swans, doesn't mean there are no black ones. And in fact marketers are only looking for white swans. They think it was invalid of me to make the fake Virtual Cat page: 'well of course if it's a low quality page you're going to get low quality likes.' But my point is this is black swan bait, something they would never make because their theory is confident in the exclusive existence of white swans.","['veritasium', 'physics', 'number game', 'solve', '2 4 8', '248', 'scientific method', 'sequences', 'series', 'sequence', 'science literacy', 'test', 'hypothesis', 'math', 'mathematics', 'black swan', 'white swan']",2014-02-24T14:30:02Z,13615969,292826,0,21968,PT4M44S,hd,true

Many stories have circulated claiming the longest anyone has stayed in an ultra-quiet anechoic chamber is 45 minutes, the reason being any longer would drive you insane. To me this sounded like unsubstantiated rubbish, like the claim the Great Wall is the only manmade structure visible from space. So I put my own psyche on the line, subjecting myself to over an hour of the most intense quiet on Earth. No, this was not THE quietest room on Earth (-9dB) but it is one of the quietest, and the truth is once you put a person inside, they are by far the loudest thing in there so the sound rating of the room is irrelevant.

I was not surprised to find that I could stay in there for as long as I liked and feel perfectly fine. What was surprising is that my heartbeat was audible. You can hear it on the sound recording. Now I wasn't consciously aware of the sound of my heart while in the room, but I was more aware of the feeling of it beating.

My first vid on the problem with Facebook: http://bit.ly/1dXudqY
I know first-hand that Facebook's advertising model is deeply flawed. When I paid to promote my page I gained 80,000 followers in developing countries who didn't care about Veritasium (but I wasn't aware of this at the time). They drove my reach and engagement numbers down, basically rendering the page useless. I am not the only one who has experienced this. Rory Cellan-Jones had the same luck with Virtual Bagel: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18819338

The US Department of State spent $630,000 to acquire 2 million page likes and then realized only 2% were engaged. http://wapo.st/1glcyZo

I thought I would demonstrate that the same thing is still happening now by creating Virtual Cat (http://www.facebook.com/MyVirtualCat). I was surprised to discover something worse - false likes are coming from everywhere, including Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia. So even those carefully targeting their campaigns are likely being duped into spending real money on fake followers. Then when they try to reach their followers they have to pay again.

And it's possible to be a victim of fake likes without even advertising. Pages that end up on Facebook's ""International Suggested Pages"" are also easy targets for click-farms seeking to diversify their likes. http://tnw.co/NsflrC

Is punishment or reward more effective for helping people learn. A lot of people would say different incentives motivate different people, or in different circumstances, but in psychology there is a sizable body of evidence that in order to learn skills, positive feedback is more effective. This fining has been verified not just with humans, but also with other species.

It was strange then that after Daniel Kahneman discussed this research with Israeli fighter pilot instructors that he was met with resistance. They found the opposite was true: when they reprimanded a cadet for performing poorly, he invariably improved, but if they praised a cadet for an excellent performance, the next attempt was not as good. In order to solve this apparent contradiction we first need to understand regression to the mean.

Magnetism seems like a pretty magical phenomenon. Rocks that attract or repel each other at a distance - that's really cool - and electric current in a wire interacts in the same way. What's even more amazing is how it works. We normally think of special relativity as having little bearing on our lives because everything happens at such low speeds that relativistic effects are negligible. But when you consider the large number of charges in a wire and the strength of the electric interaction, you can see that electromagnets function thanks to the special relativistic effect of length contraction. In a frame of reference moving with the charges, there is an electric field that creates a force on the charges. But in the lab frame, there is no electric field so it must be a magnetic field creating the force. Hence we see that a magnetic field is what an electric field becomes when an electrically charged object starts moving.

Everyone has played with a mixture of corn starch and water (or at least I hope they have). This was one of my favorite experiments as a kid. Your hand slides into the slime easily when moving slowly but the mixture behaves as a solid if you hit it quickly. That is what is meant by 'non-Newtonian' - the fluid's properties change depending on its relative motion. These properties can be exploited to dramatic effect as has been shown on speaker cones before. Here I wanted to understand what is going on, what frequencies and amplitudes work best so I used a slow-mo camera.

We have looked at how a transistor works, the fundamental unit of classical computers, and how a quantum computer works in theory, taking advantage of quantum superposition to hold exponentially more information than classical computers. Now we look at the practical side of making a quantum bit, or qubit. How do you put it in a state where it is stable? How do you read and write information on it? These processes are described for a solid state qubit - a phosphorous atom in a silicon crystal substrate. Both the electron and the nucleus of the phosphorous atom can be used as qubits.

When I mentioned to people that I was doing a video on transistors, they would say ""as in a transistor radio?"" Yes! That's exactly what I mean, but it goes so much deeper than that. After the transistor was invented in 1947 one of the first available consumer technologies it was applied to was radios, so they could be made portable and higher quality. Hence the line in 'Brown-eyed Girl' - ""going down to the old mine with a transistor radio.""

But more important to our lives today, the transistor made possible the microcomputer revolution, and hence the Internet, and also TVs, mobile phones, fancy washing machines, dishwashers, calculators, satellites, projectors etc. etc. A transistor is based on semiconductor material, usually silicon, which is 'doped' with impurities to carefully change its electrical properties. These n and p-type semiconductors are then put together in different configurations to achieve a desired electrical result. And in the case of the transistor, this is to make a tiny electrical switch. These switches are then connected together to perform computations, store information, and basically make everything electrical work intelligently.

A quantum computer works in a totally different way from a classical computer. Quantum bits or 'qubits' can exist in a superposition state of both zero and one simultaneously. This means that a set of two qubits can be in a superposition of four states, which therefore require four numbers to uniquely identify the state. So the amount of information stored in N qubits is two to the power of N classical bits.

The Higgs mechanism is meant to account for the mass of everything, right? Well no, only the fundamental particles, which means that electrons derive their mass entirely from the Higgs interaction but protons and neutrons, made of quarks, do not. In fact the quark masses are so small that they only make up about 1% of the mass of the proton (and a similar fraction of the neutron). The rest of the mass comes from the energy in the gluon field. Gluons are massless, but there is so much energy in the field that by E=mc^2 there is a significant amount of mass there. This is where most of your mass comes from and the mass of virtually everything around you.

It actually takes energy to clear out space and make a true 'empty' vacuum. This seems incredibly counter-intuitive but we can make an analogy to a permanent magnet. When at low energies, like at room temperature, there is a magnetic field around the magnet due to the alignment of all the magnetic moments of the atoms. But if you add some energy to it by heating it, the particles gain thermal energy, which above the Curie temperature makes their magnetic moments randomly oriented and hence destroying the magnetic field. So in this case energy is needed to clear out the field, just as in the quantum vacuum.

Instead, water is pumped out of the lake by the jetski at up to 60 litres a second. It is then fired out of the nozzles at around 15 m/s creating 1800 N of force, the equivalent of about 150 fire extinguishers. On me this can produce acceleration of about 1.5g's.

1195,ZMByI4s-D-Y,Veritasium,World's Roundest Object!,"The world's roundest object helps solve the longest running problem in measurement -- how to define the kilogram.
Support Veritasium on Patreon: http://bit.ly/VePatreon

A kilogram isn't what it used to be. Literally. The original name for it was the 'grave', proposed in 1793 but it fell victim to the French Revolution like its creator, Lavoisier. So begins the tale of the most unusual SI unit. The kilogram is the only base unit with a prefix in its name, and the only one still defined by a physical artifact, the international prototype kilogram or IPK.

But the problem with this definition has long been apparent. The IPK doesn't seem to maintain its mass compared to 40 similar cylinders minted at the same time. The goal is therefore to eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object. Two main approaches are being considered to achieve this end: the Avogadro Project and the Watt Balance.

The Avogadro project aims to redefine Avogadro's constant (currently defined by the kilogram -- the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12) and reverse the relationship so that the kilogram is precisely specified by Avogadro's constant. This method required creating the most perfect sphere on Earth. It is made out of a single crystal of silicon 28 atoms. By carefully measuring the diameter, the volume can be precisely specified. Since the atom spacing of silicon is well known, the number of atoms in a sphere can be accurately calculated. This allows for a very precise determination of Avogadro's constant.

Special thanks to Katie Green, Dr. David Farrant, the CSIRO, and the National Measurment Institute for their help. Thanks also to Nessy Hill for filming and reviewing earlier drafts of this video.

There is debate as to whether this is truly the roundest object ever created. The Gravity Probe-B rotors are also spherical with very low tolerances such that they may in fact be rounder.

1196,GzbKb59my3U,Veritasium,Single Photon Interference,"What happens when single photons of light pass through a double slit and are detected by a photomultiplier tube? In 1801 Thomas Young seemed to settle a long-running debate about the nature of light with his double slit experiment. He demonstrated that light passing through two slits creates patterns like water waves, with the implication that it must be a wave phenomenon.

However, experimental results in the early 1900s found that light energy is not smoothly distributed as in a classical wave, rather it comes in discrete packets, called quanta and later photons. These are indivisible particles of light. So what would happen if individual photons passed through a double slit? Would they make a pattern like waves or like particles?","['veritasium', 'science', 'experiments', 'experiment', 'physics', 'double slit', 'double slit experiment', 'young', 'single photon', 'quantum', 'quanta', 'photons', 'light', 'interference', 'two slit', 'Photon (Subatomic Particle)', 'photomultiplier tube', 'wave-particle', 'wave', 'particle', 'wave-particle duality', 'duality']",2013-03-13T14:01:06Z,1017331,24635,0,2518,PT6M,hd,false

For clarification on this video, please see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7tfrTh66c
What would you see if you were drifting through space, looking back at the sun? Well its light intensity would decrease as the inverse square of distance from the sun. And you would imagine the intensity would decrease smoothly, asymptotically approaching zero.

But this is not what happens.

If you had sensitive enough eyes, like frogs' eyes, you would find that at some point the sun would start to flicker. You would see flashes of light separated by complete darkness. And as you drift further from the sun, what's strange is that these flashes do not decrease in brightness, but they do become less frequent. That's because light comes in lumps, called quanta or photons, which are indivisible. So if you try to spread light out very thinly, you reach a point where there are only single bits of light reaching an observer's eye at any given time.

1198,Iuv6hY6zsd0,Veritasium,The Original Double Slit Experiment,"Light is so common that we rarely think about what it really is. But just over two hundred years ago, a groundbreaking experiment answered the question that had occupied physicists for centuries. Is light made up of waves or particles?

The experiment was conducted by Thomas Young and is known as Young's Double Slit Experiment. This famous experiment is actually a simplification of a series of experiments on light conducted by Young. In a completely darkened room, Young allowed a thin beam of sunlight to pass through an aperture on his window and onto two narrow, closely spaced openings (the double slit). This sunlight then cast a shadow onto the wall behind the apparatus. Young found that the light diffracted as it passed through the slits, and then interfered with itself, created a series of light and dark spots. Since the sunlight consists of all colours of the rainbow, these colours were also visible in the projected spots. Young concluded that light consist of waves and not particles since only waves were known to diffract and interfere in exactly the manner that light did in his experiment.

The way I have always seen this experiment performed is with a laser and a manufactured double slit but since the experiment was conducted in 1801 I have always thought that it should be possible to recreate the experiment using sunlight and household materials. That is basically what I did here. I will show the interference pattern I observed with my homemade double slit on 2Veritasium but I chose to use a manufactured double slit here to ensure that the pattern was impressive for observers at the beach.

Special thanks to Henry, Brady, and Rupert for their cameos, Glen for filming and Josh for helping create the apparatus. Thanks also to the Royal Society for allowing us to view the original manuscript of Young's lecture and the University of Sydney for lending the double slits.

Subscribe to Veritasium - it's free! http://bit.ly/YSWpWm


But it's not just Australia - it seems like all beautiful, warm places are cursed with venomous native species. So I set out to find the truth: why have all these venomous species evolved in the world's best holiday destinations?

I asked chemists, visited the zoo, interviewed entomologists and snake experts. The answer I found was complicated:
1. The majority of venomous species are ectotherms, cold-blooded creatures whose internal temperatures are governed by their surroundings.
2. This means they have limited periods of activity - mainly while it's warm out, and can only exert short bursts of energy, so they are generally ""sit and wait"" predators. This may explain why they, more than mammals or birds, evolved venom.
3. It also explains why there are more of these species in warm climates. There are more of all species in warm climates, but this trend is especially pronounced for ectotherms.
4. So there are a greater number of venomous species in warm places, simply because there are more species in warm places. Cold climates still have venomous creatures, like the rattlesnakes of Canada and European vipers.
5. But history also has a role to play. In Australia, there were no snakes until 20 million years ago when a venomous sea snake from Asia encountered the land, sending venomous species to all corners of the continent. Later non-venomous arrivals have done well in the tropics but not as well in Australia's colder climates, so venomous types still dominate there. Hawaii has no venomous land snakes and nor does Jamaica.
6. The recent ice age also would have driven ectotherms from the northern parts of the Northern Hemisphere. This is why there are no snakes in Ireland, for example.

As the slit is made narrower, the spot on the screen also becomes narrower. But at a certain point, the spot starts becoming wider. This is because the photons of light have been so localised at the slit that their horizontal momentum must become less well defined in order to satisfy Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

For the Sixty Symbols version of this experiment click http://bit.ly/RGfLY5

Michael Faraday created the first electric generator in 1831 using a coil of wire and a permanent magnet. When the magnet was moved relative to the coil, current was induced in the coil. A similar experiment can be performed with a copper tube and a magnet. Although copper is not magnetic, it is a conductor. As the magnet falls through the pipe, the magnetic field changes over different sections of the pipe. This induces swirling currents (called eddy currents), which create a magetic field that opposes the motion of the magnet. This means work must be done to move the magnet through the pipe. This work generates the electrical energy, which is then dissipated as thermal energy in the pipe. The same basic principle is used to generate electricity throughout the world: moving a magnet inside copper coils.

Although its mass has been measured around 125-126 GeV most of the other properties of the particle remain unknown. Its spin appears to be 0 or 2 but more results are required to nail this down. If it is the standard model Higgs, the spin should be 0, resulting in a fairly symmetric distribution of decay products in the detectors.

We may know this year if it's not the standard model Higgs - this would be the case if it doesn't decay into specific particles with the expected frequency. However if it is the standard model Higgs, it may take many more years to be certain. The large hadron collider will be shut down in 2013 for upgrades so that higher energies up to 14 TeV can be tested. Right now the LHC is operating at 8 TeV.

Electromagnetic Induction,"At the Palais de la Decouverte in Paris, they showed me this experiment where a 1kg aluminium plate is levitated above a large coil of wire that is being supplied with 800A of alternating current at 900Hz. This is by far the best demonstration of electromagnetic induction I have ever seen.

Back in London, I visited the magnetic lab of Michael Faraday in the basement of the Royal Institution. It was here that he did his groundbreaking work on induction. People had previously observed that current in a wire causes a compass needle to deflect, but more exciting was the prospect of using a magnetic field to generate current. Faraday created his famous induction ring by winding two coils of insulated wire onto an iron ring. When he connected a battery to one coil, a small pulse of current was induced in the other. When the battery was disconnected, current was induced in the other direction. This led Faraday to the conclusion that current was induced in the second coil only when the magnetic field through it was changing.

And if they hadn't been wrapped on the same ring, Faraday may have noticed that the two coils repel each other when the current is induced due to the interaction of their magnetic fields. This is the same thing that is happening with the aluminium plate, except we're using alternating current to create a continually changing magnetic field. This induces an alternating current in the plate, producing an opposing magnetic field which levitates the disk.","['levitation', 'induction', 'induced', 'current', 'eddy currents', 'eddy current', 'electromagnetism', 'faraday', ""faraday's law"", 'michael faraday', 'alternating current', 'magnetism', 'magnetic repulsion', 'magnet', 'electromagnet', 'veritasium', 'experiments', 'science', 'physics', 'electricity']",2012-10-09T15:57:50Z,2349300,37417,0,2340,PT3M46S,hd,true

What is interesting is that this decreases the temperature of the liquid. The fastest molecules escape, leaving the slower ones behind.
Using this trick with liquid nitrogen, it is possible to create solid nitrogen at a temperature of -210C. We then poured the solid and liquid nitrogen mixture onto a tray of water. The surface of the water became so cold that CO2 solidified out of the atmosphere on its surface. Then, since CO2 does not pass through the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure, it was propelled on the water surface by jets of gas as it sublimed.

Is a flame really a plasma? Well it depends on your definition of plasma, but there are certainly ions in a flame, formed as molecules collide with each other at high speed, sometimes knocking electrons off of their atoms.

Special thanks to the Palais de la Decouverte for helping me perform this experiment. Using tens of thousands of volts on two metal plates, we created a strong electric field around the plasma. This pulled positive ions in one direction and negative ions in the other direction elongating the flame horizontally and causing it to flicker like a ""papillon"" (butterfly). Then we showed that much longer sparks can be made through the flame than through air since the ions increase the conductivity.","['flame', 'electric', 'charged', 'ions', 'plasma', 'experiments', 'electric field', 'voltage', 'veritasium', 'science', 'physics']",2012-09-11T19:00:26Z,4436769,47600,0,2598,PT2M41S,hd,true
1214,qiiFMRYUEQM,Veritasium,How Can Trees Be Taller Than 10m?,"Answer video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BickMFHAZR0
The longest vertical straw you can use is 10.3 m http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUmZrtiXDik
This is because the weight of water in the straw must be supported by the pressure difference at its two ends. At the bottom, the pressure is atmospheric, and at the top, the lowest pressure you can create is a perfect vacuum (pressure = 0). Atmospheric pressure can support a water column about 10m high - BUT with 0 pressure at the top, the water would start boiling. This is called cavitation and it obviously can't be happening in trees.
After I posted the straw video, I received a lot of questions about how trees could be taler than 10m. I assumed there was a simple answer because there are plenty of trees taller than that. But as I asked around and read articles about it, I couldn't really find an explanation I was happy with.

Maybe there is not a continuous water column inside the tree, so each section only lifts water a little ways? This could be but it seems to require a series of pump mechanisms, and how would you join this pump sections together? Perhaps capillary action is holding the water up? But the xylem tubes in a tree seem too wide (~50 um) for this effect to be significant. Maybe osmotic pressure could push the water from below rather than sucking it up from above? But some trees live in mangroves, where there is much higher solute concentration in the sea water than in their roots, so osmosis would work the other way.

Eventually I spoke to a plant biologist and sorted this all out, but I wanted to give you a little back to school challenge. How do you think this could work?","['trees', 'transport water osmosis', 'pressure', 'photosynthesis', 'water', 'longest straw', '10m', '33 feet', 'gradient', 'height', 'tall', 'veritasium science physics']",2012-09-03T14:00:30Z,288400,4306,0,1000,PT4M16S,hd,false

More with Canadian Olympian Hunter Lowden: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YVOPUkbu6g

How does a sailboat work? The standard idea is that the wind pushes the sails from behind, causing the boat to move forward. Although this technique is used at times, it is not the most efficient way to sail a boat (and it means the boat can never go faster than the wind). Lift is the key mechanism driving a boat forwards. As air flows over the sails, it moves faster over the outer side, creating lower pressure than on the inner side. This produces a force which is mostly to the side and a bit forwards. Lift on the centerboard pushes to the opposite side, cancelling the sideways force and adding a forward component of force to the boat.

We have been collaborating on rotational motion, which is timely for some of the videos I've been doing lately. In this video I talk about gyroscopic precession - the ""wobbling"" of a spinning top around its axis.

This is caused by the torque due to the object's weight. The big idea is that the torque vector increases angular momentum in the direction of torque. So if there is no angular momentum initially, it will cause the system to swing in such a direction that it is rotating with new angular momentum in the direction of the torque. However, if there was angular momentum to begin with, the torque will change the direction of that angular momentum by causing precession.","['gyroscope', 'precession', 'gyroscopic precession', 'spinning', 'rotation', 'rotational motion', 'rotational', 'experiments', 'veritasium', 'spin', 'spinning top', 'wobble', 'torque', 'angular momentum']",2012-05-23T06:15:14Z,4461380,57584,0,2755,PT3M49S,hd,true

I have been working with Catalyst on ABC1 to bring some Veritasium to Australian TV. In this segment I ask why astronauts in the space station are weightless. The most common answer is because there is no gravity in space. But of course there is gravity in space, especially where the space station is located (only about 400km from Earth's surface). So astronauts still experience a gravitational pull - it's just that they and the space station are in free fall so they are accelerating together towards the Earth. The space station doesn't crash into the Earth because of its orbital velocity - it's going 28,000 km/h so as it falls, the Earth curves away from it.","['weightlessness', 'weightless', 'astronauts', 'space station', 'gravity', 'space', 'gravity in space', 'zero g', '0g', 'veritasium']",2012-05-13T04:04:58Z,636828,8663,0,1561,PT3M41S,sd,true

It is converting its own mass into energy. By combining protons (the nucleus of hydrogen) into helium, it squeezes some mass into energy - 4.3 billion kg per second. It is Einstein's famous E=mc^2 which gives us the quantitative relationship between mass and energy, where c is the speed of light.","['sun', 'energy', 'fusion', 'e=mc2', 'nuclear fusion', 'e=mc^2', 'mass into energy', 'mass', 'nuclear', 'nucleus', 'stars', 'proton', 'fuel', 'helium', 'core', 'veritasium']",2012-05-06T16:27:16Z,1738248,25152,0,4183,PT6M1S,hd,true

Theories about its origins have been debated for centuries and common misconceptions persist that the aurora is the sun's rays scattered off ice crystals in the high atmosphere. In truth, the light is created more than 100km above Earth's surface as high speed electrons and protons ejected from the sun in a solar flare or coronal mass ejection collide with air molecules in the upper atmosphere. The charged particles from the sun excite air molecules which then de-excite by emitting light. The display is most common around the north and south poles because the Earth's magnetic field deflects the solar wind from the equator to the poles. Here the magnetic field dips towards the Earth's surface, channeling the charged particles into the atmosphere.

Science has uncovered a lot of counterintuitive things about the universe, so it's unsurprising that non-scientists hold beliefs inconsistent with science. But when we teach, we must take into account what the learners know, including their incorrect knowledge. That is the reason a lot of Veritasium videos start with the misconceptions.

Research has shown that these types of videos may be positively received by students.

Students have existing ideas about scientific phenomena before viewing a video. If the video presents scientific concepts in a clear, well illustrated way, students believe they are learning but they do not engage with the media on a deep enough level to realize that what was is presented differs from their prior knowledge.

Well, they aren't floating - they're falling, along with the space station. They don't crash into the Earth because they have a huge orbital velocity.

That is, are the forces on the Earth and the moon equal? Most people would say no, the Earth exerts a greater force of attraction because it is larger and has more mass. This is a situation in which Newton's Third Law is relevant. Newton's Third Law says that for every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. So the force the Earth exerts on the moon must be exactly equal and opposite the force the moon exerts on the Earth. But how can that be - that the same size force keeps the moon orbiting, but barely affects the Earth? The answer is inertia - the tendency for all objects with mass to maintain their state of motion. Since the Earth has much more mass than the moon, it has greater inertia and therefore experiences much less acceleration for the same amount of force.","[""Newton's Third Law"", ""Newton's Laws"", 'gravity', 'gravitational force', 'inertia', 'earth', 'moon', ""moon's orbit"", 'force of attraction', 'science literacy']",2011-02-25T10:57:23Z,1557818,33012,0,4566,PT4M38S,hd,true

Instead the resistance felt is an indication of the car's mass which determines its inertia. Inertia is the property of matter that means it tends to resist acceleration - the greater the mass, the less the acceleration for a given amount of force.","['mass vs. weight', 'weight vs. mass', 'mass', 'weight', 'inertia', 'public awareness of science', 'forces', 'gravity', 'heavy', ""Newton's Laws"", 'science literacy']",2011-02-07T17:13:23Z,991830,9276,0,1447,PT3M15S,hd,true

There was debate over whether the cathode ray was a wave phenomenon like light or a stream of negatively charged particles. JJ Thomson effectively resolved the debate in 1897 by performing a clever experiment that determined the charge to mass ratio of the particles making up the cathode ray. He also showed that this same particle was in all different cathode materials so it must be a constituent common to all atoms.

Why were the Yugoslav Partisans so Good in World War 2?

The first benefit to Tito’s movement was his multi-ethnic inclusivity. Instead of appealing to one ethnic group as other resistance movements, such as the Chetniks, had done, the Yugoslav Partisans aimed to include the whole of Yugoslavia. Utilizing the philosophy of “brotherhood and unity”, Tito was able to successfully rally support from all throughout the contemporary Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

How did the Industrial Revolution Happen?

The Industrial Revolution first began in Great Britain during the latter half of the 18th century. Throughout the next century, the process of mechanizing the factory systems, replacing hand production with machine production processes, and the growing uses of steam and water power all contributed to the industrialization first of Britain and soon of the rest of Europe and the United States as British entrepreneurs eagerly exported this new knowledge and way of life to their neighbors and allies.

It’s said, furthermore, that where there is smoke there must be fire, and in this case, that rings true. All of the jokes and memes about the Holy Roman Empire being a bit of a mess didn’t come from nothing. The HRE really was pretty inadequate - relatively, at least.

It all began back in the 17th century when the British East India Company established budding trade relations with China. These ties would strengthen over time as the East India Company grew to dominate European trade with China and eventually led, in the mid 18th century, to the foundation of the Canton System in which the contemporary Chinese Qing  dynasty would be able to better control the booming trade with the British.

Skanderbeg. Born in the early 15th century by the name of Gjergj Kastrioti in the contemporary Principality of Kastrioti within modern-day Albania, his name now marks history books with the weight of a national hero and military marvel.
He was the son of Gjon and Voisava Kastrioti, a noble family of the Principality of Kastrioti which existed within the current Albanian borders and stood as one of the European Christian strongholds against the Ottoman Empire for some time, but eventually fell into vassalship nonetheless. As a common practice of this time, vassals were required to send one or more of their children to the Ottoman court as political hostages in a deal to ensure the loyalty of the family and principality...

Why did the Iberian Union Fail?

The Iberian Peninsula is the home to two once-upon-a-time colonial empires that have survived as strong and sovereign nations, side by side, for many centuries. Often though, many wonder how this actually happened, and particularly, how Spain never managed to take over its smaller neighbor who was locked between Spain and the North Atlantic Ocean. Well, in reality, this actually almost happened at one point - although not in the way most may have expected…

How did Germany plan to capture Russian Oil Fields in World War 1?

During World War One from 1914 through 1918, humanity was locked in a constant struggle. The warfare was intensely brutal and most people scarcely remember the overshadowed diplomacy that eventually brought an end to the violence. Furthermore, many of the lesser-known conflicts and hidden agendas of the participants in the war have been long forgotten or ignored. One of these particular subjects was the German plan to capture Russian oil fields before the war’s end…

This generally leaves us wondering why the Italians would have felt so compelled to betray their initial teammates, but it also tends to distract from the first decision made by the Italians to even be part of the Axis, to begin with. And consequently, this often results in a lack of understanding for why the Italians ever aligned themselves with Germany if they were only going to deceive them with such ease later on. So, why did Italy ever join the Axis Powers?...

Why didn't Rome conquer Persia?

Throughout history, Persia has proven itself to be a land of mighty empires and unconquerable strength. Despite attempts to do just that, even great imperial powers such as the Ottoman Empire have failed time after time to take from Persia what belonged to its people. Even one of the mightiest empires to ever walk the earth never got around to conquering Persia. So, with that being said, why did the Romans fall short of checking this challenge off their bucket list?...

How did the Mongols Conquer China?

 The Mongol Empire. The imperial power has become a thing of fame around the globe as the home of the legendary Ghengis Khan. 

 When most people think of the Mongol Empire, they think of power, conquest, and of course, Ghengis Khan.


But not so often, some may ask how the Mongols managed to become synonymous with such words and legends. After all, this single empire managed to be the first to bring every inch of China - which was at that point made up of an amalgamation of separate entities - under the control of a foreign power. This feat would have been impressive in any case, but the gravity of the accomplishment is strengthened by the fact that the Mongol Empire faced a multitude of opponents and locally established dynasties that they managed to defeat in order to seize the entire region. So, how exactly did they manage to do this?...

It was the empire that seized Constantinople and collapsed the Byzantine Empire, and its cultural expansion still remains throughout some of its former vassal states today. But there will always be curiosity as to why any empire stopped where it did, and what prevented further growth before the ultimate collapse. In the case of the Ottomans, one question that comes to mind is why didn’t the Ottomans conquer Persia?...

After slowly taking down each of its pesky neighbors, including the Sabines, one of the first major conflicts the young republic found itself in was the Battle of Lake Regillus.
At the start of the 5th century BC, the Latin League and the Romans met at Lake Regillus as Rome’s new dictator at the time, Aulus Postumius Albus hoped to defeat the remaining threat to Rome’s growing authority.

Why isn't Eastern Germany Religious?

Around the globe, Europe is generally heavily associated with the religion of Christianity, just as the Middle East is usually linked to Islam, and so on and so forth. The general assumption about European countries is that they are probably at least mostly populated by Christians, even if the nation itself hasn’t declared any official state religion. And while this is often a pretty accurate assumption, in some cases, such as with Germany, it’s not so straightforward…

The existence of England is one that is often taken for granted and looked at far too scarcely. This may be due to the overshadowing history of the development of Great Britain and the United Kingdom, but nonetheless, in order for these unions to be formed, England had to already exist - and it actually has since 927 AD. So, how was England created, who claimed the land before the English, and how did it become the nation that we know today?...

When you have as many expansionist powers as the European continent did during the early modern and colonial eras, it can become difficult to maintain a peaceful, easy-flowing system. With limited land available and everyone wanting a piece of all of it, how were these ambitious nations meant to split it all up without going to war? Negotiation was always an option, but of course, it was much easier said than done. Still, two nations in particular actually did broker a deal, peacefully, for the division of unconquered land. And this was no small deal either - it was not simply a distribution of one or two territories. Instead, these nations, Portugal and Spain, planned to rule the New World - together…

 Japan wasn’t actually completely free of European interference. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to land in Japan when a group of Portuguese traders anchored their ship on the shores of Nipponese in 1543. A new relationship between Japan and Portugal suddenly began to grow, mostly centered on economics, but religion quickly became a talking point as well. 

Commerce was a huge factor in the Portuguese influence over Japan. Most of their trading goods were coming from China, which had long been off-limits to Japan after a ban of contact was put in place by the Chinese emperor. This meant that the Portuguese had something that the Japanese really wanted but would be unable to get on their own. It was a perfect system and worked well for a few decades. The Japanese could purchase goods like silk and porcelain from China, without having to go directly through Chinese merchants, and the Portuguese were able to expand their influence into Asia even further. Firearms were another popular purchase of the Japanese, especially during the Sengoku Period of civil war.

Europe has always been home to conflicts and power struggles across the map. For a continent so big and intertwined, and with frequently shifting borders all throughout history, it’s no surprise that war would often become inevitable. 
In the case of Central Europe, as the second half of the 19th century came around, the clash for dominance and consolidated power over the region would be between the mighty Austrian Empire and the rising state of Prussia…
The Kingdom of Prussia, at this time, was part of the German Confederation and was becoming the most powerful and influential of the incorporated states next to the Austrian Empire. Its leaders were the Hohenzollern family and in particular, King Wilhelm I alongside Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck.

Why did Greater Colombia Collapse?

Numerous countries, unions, and sovereign states have risen and fallen over the many years of our history. One of these collapsed states is known by the name of Gran Colombia, or, “Greater Colombia”, and lasted from 1819 to only 1831.

Gran Colombia, which was at that time known simply as Colombia, was made up of today’s Republic of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela, in addition to also including bits of both Peru and Brazil.

As the Soviet Union worked tirelessly to keep the Iron Curtain up and strong after the second world war, Czechoslovakia unintentionally became a threat to this objective. As a satellite state of the Union, Czechoslovakia was meant to remain a firm communist-led country, just like the rest of the Eastern Bloc. So, when a new Czech government began a process of reform known as the “Prague Spring”, the Soviet Union quickly became concerned. In hopes of quelling these liberating reform efforts, the Soviets reached out to their Warsaw Pact allies to plan an invasion into Czechoslovakia and intervene. Poland, Bulgaria, East Germany, and Hungary subsequently threw their support behind this Soviet plan - but two nations refused to do so. Both Albania and Romania were unwilling to join the invasion, and Romania’s Nicolae Ceaușescu went out of his way to condemn the operation. 

So what made Romania so unwilling to join the Warsaw Pact Invasion of Czechoslovakia?...

As the powers of Europe began to grow and expand throughout the world’s history, colonialism became the forefront of this expansion. Over time, almost every non-European nation became a colony of one European nation or another at some point. Only a few countries managed to escape becoming overpowered by the Europeans, which makes us wonder, how did they do it? For a nation like Thailand, which was surrounded by British, French, and Dutch territories, there seemed to be no hope of avoiding colonialism. And yet, somehow, not the British, nor the French, or even the Dutch, ever colonized Thailand - and neither did any other European power. So if Thailand was never subject to colonialism, how did it manage to pull that off?...

Why is Andorra a Country? - History of Andorra in 10 Minutes

If you’ve never seen Andorra on a map, that’s probably because it’s not very easy to see. And if you have, you may be wondering, why is it even a country? A nation so small that it gets lost from sight between the border of Spain and France ever so easily. So why does it exist?


Even more curious than the fact that tiny Andorra is utterly and overwhelmingly landlocked between Spain and France, it also is actually a co-principality between the two. Both neighbors share a certain level of authority over Andorra still today, and they have for many years.

The origins of the sovereign state, at least according to Andorra itself, can be traced all the way back to the time of Charlemagne. The story goes that when the Frankish king set up a series of buffer states between Christian France and Muslim-controlled al-Andalus, Andorra was one of the states to serve as part of this Marca Hispanica buffer, and is the only remaining state of the region as well.

By 756, the remaining Umayyad leader, Abd al-Rahman I, outright refused to acknowledge the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Instead, he managed to depose the Abbasid rulers in the area and proclaimed the capital of Umayyad Iberia, Córdoba, to be an independent emirate, known as the Emirate of Córdoba. Much to Rahman’s pleasure, he was able to do so without much pushback, and he and his descendants became the rulers of this new Emirate for many decades to come. While these emirs technically only ruled over Córdoba itself, many of them actually extended their authority throughout more of the peninsula.

After the end of the Great War… and after an unsatisfactory peace, huge inflation, and an unprecedented economic crisis, Germany was on its knees…    
Even being a country with huge economic potential, due to the factories and companies that still existed there, Germany was, however, only a shadow of the former monarchy.
But ... from 1933 to 1941 Germany achieved what it had not realized in the previous war. It had a new army that was considered unstoppable, acting with precision, speed, and communication, taking by surprise the great European powers!
Thus, at the end of 1941, almost all of Europe was controlled by Germany and its allies.
German soldiers could see the buildings of Moscow from a distance ... Almost all predictions led to a total German victory.
But How did this all happen? Was it just the efficiency of the German Army? Or was it a multitude of reasons, including sound planning or even luck?

Why did the Soviet Union Collapse?

As the Iron Curtain fell, over a dozen nations were finally freed from the heavy-handed grasp of the once-powerful U.S.S.R. From its foundation in 1922 until its final demise in 1991, the Soviet Union and its allies made up an incredibly significant portion of Europe - essentially filling out the entire Eastern side of the continent. A global superpower at its peak, the U.S.S.R. somehow only lasted a short 70 years. How is this possible? And why, exactly, did the Soviet Union collapse?...

The crusades were a miraculous combined effort of multiple Christian nations throughout Europe to unify and take back the Holy Land from their Muslim adversaries. A spectacular feat, given how much Europe’s nations were usually at war with each other, the crusades should, in theory, have been a mighty display of passion and strength. Yet, somehow, the crusades failed. Why, and how, did this happen?...

Yugoslavia. For many, a long-forgotten failed nation. For others, an all-too painful, and recent, memory. A once-united federation made up of six neighboring republics, Yugoslavia’s existence was never a simple one. With constant ethnic and religious division, it seems that it was only a matter of time before a breakup would be imminent. But was that the only cause of Yugoslavia’s collapse? And how did the ethnic disputes actually lead to the destruction of an entire federation?...

Spain, France, and Great Britain all played crucial roles in the development of what is now the influential United States of America. Motivated by economic reasons, and trying to expand their trade network and financial power, many European Nations ventured in search of more opportunities. But, today, most people particularly remember the colonial efforts of the English above all else. So, how did the English colonize America?

The Ottoman Empire was founded circa 1299 by Osman I in northwestern Asia Minor, south of the Byzantine capital Constantinople. The Ottomans crossed into Europe in 1352, moving their capital to Adrianople in 1369. They expanded in Asia Minor by annexing many small Turkic beylics.
 They conquered Constantinople in 1453, and then expanded deep into Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East. The Ottoman territory increased exponentially under Sultan Selim I, who assumed the Caliphate in 1517 as the Ottomans defeated the Mamluks of Egypt and annexed western Arabia, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Levant. Within the next few decades, much of the North African coast became part of the Ottoman realm. Slowly after many wars and internal problems, the Ottoman sultanate started to crumble.

The year before the outbreak of World War One, Imperial Germany also boasted the largest economy in Continental Europe and placed only third behind the United States and the British Empire on the world scale. With a robust military and rapidly prospering home status, the German Empire was ready for even more success and power, and that is exactly what they would aim to take…""

 From 1867 through 1918, the nation was locked in the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary, until their defeat in World War One brought about a split. By this point, the Republic of German-Austria was born and lasted only a short time, before being replaced in September of 1919 by the First Austrian Republic. The new state survived just under two decades, with Austrian autonomy being challenged once more as the Germans marched onto Austrian soil on March 12, 1938. The annexation, known as Anschluss, seemed to yet again confirm that Austria was simply destined to never be a country of its own - but why? And why was it so easy for the Germans to annex Austria?

Defying the authority and widespread influence of the Sunni Muslim Abbasid Caliphate, the Ismaili Muslim Fatimid Caliphate made its mark on history and remains a significant factor in the relevance of Islam throughout its time. So, why did the Fatimid Caliphate fall from grace after only 2 centuries? And how, exactly, did the Fatimid Caliphate collapse?

The incursion by Italian troops into Africa became known as the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, or the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, as it was named at the time. The conflict came without warning and was accompanied by no declaration of war. Rather, at 5 A.M. on October 3, 1935, Marshal Emilio De Bono led 200,000 Italian Army men into Ethiopia from the neighboring Italian territory of Eritrea. Simultaneously, a smaller chunk of troops was led by General Rodolfo Graziani from Italian Somaliland.

♦ The Protestant Reformation is widely known for Martin Luther’s publication of his “95 Theses” or “Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences” and marks the second schism of sorts for the Catholic church.  In reality, the reformation of western Christianity was long in the making, and Martin Luther was not its only leader…
 While many view the start of the Protestant Reformation as having been in 1517 following the publication of Martin Luther’s theses, the actual date of its beginning is somewhat unclear.  There were essentially three main reformation movements; one in Germany, one in England, and one in Switzerland - with all of them occurring around the same time in the 16th century.

The history of the Ottoman Empire is vast and more than interesting. Starting even before the sultanate itself, with the arrival of Turkish Tribes in Anatolia, the Battle of Manzikert, the creation of various sultanates, and then the start of the Ottoman Dynasty… This Empire that existed for 600 years, dominated its neighbors, won battles and wars, expanded quickly, and became a predator in this part of the world, achieving Great Success. 

But... as History has always shown us since the beginning of time, that every action has a reaction, every day becomes night and every Empire has its downfall, as other empires before them, The Ottomans did write their final page of History…

When Muhammad died, Abu Bakr became his successor, although not as a prophet.  The prophethood is said to have ended with Muhammad, but Abu took the title of Caliph in his place at the agreement of the Muslims of Medina.  After Abu, Umar, Uthman, and Ali maintained the Rashidun Caliphate and embarked upon new missions to spread their power and faith across the region.  During the first caliph’s reign, some of the displeased Arab tribes engaged in the Ridda Wars, or Wars of Apostasy, with the caliphate’s troops.  Following Muhammad’s passing, a handful of the tribes had broken ties with the caliphate, stating that their allegiance to Muhammad was purely a personal loyalty, and some of the tribe’s leaders went as far as claiming to be the prophet’s successor in prophethood, which sparked the discord.  Although the conflict did require military engagement, Abu and his men were quickly able to suppress the rebellions through both war and diplomacy and consolidate their power over the Arabian Peninsula so they could shift their focus outward.

The Battle of Stalingrad.  Inarguably one of the most merciless and destructive battles throughout history.  Resulting in nearly two million total casualties between August 23, 1942, through February 2, 1943, the German siege resulted in a decisive victory for the Soviets… although at the cost of over a million Russian casualties.  The numbers of the Battle of Stalingrad seem ridiculously high, on both sides.  So, why was the Battle of Stalingrad so deadly?

 The Battle of Dunkirk may have been one of the most decisive moments in World War Two history. In a miraculous escape from nearly complete destruction, the British Expeditionary Force managed to flee the grasp of the German Panzers and live to see another day. Many view the evacuation and its aftermath as the turning point for the war as a whole, while others, at a minimum, cannot deny the simple fact that had the Germans continued their attack, the British would not have been so lucky by any stretch.

By 1900, the Ottoman Empire was known as 'the sick man of Europe' due to their falling under other powers and due to their internal problems as well. The Ottomans lost region by region, and they couldn't prevent it. After centuries of hegemony over European, Asian, and African lands, the Sultanate was rapidly heading for collapse.

""The proclamation of an independent republic was not quite so simple though and sparked a series of clashes between the Indonesians and the colonizing forces of both the British and Dutch.  The British were less compelled to fight back, eventually withdrawing as the Dutch stepped in to try and retake their former possession.  After repeated failures, unsuccessful “police actions”, and growing condemnation from the far West, such as the U.S., at long last, in the final weeks of 1949, the Dutch recognized Indonesian autonomy and withdrew from the islands.

""
The start of the 15th century in the Ottoman Empire marked the final years of Bayezid I’s reign
as Sultan.

In 1400, major tensions began to rise between the Ottoman leader and a Turko-Mongol
warlord by the name of Timur. This once cold-war reached a heated climax in 1402 at the Battle
of Ankara.

While on his way back through Anatolia to confront the threat of his powerful rival, Bayezid
was caught off guard by Timur and his troops as they besieged the city of Ankara, withholding
the only source of water for the Ottoman troops and forcing them to engage in battle. By the
end of the conflict, Timur’s army prevailed while Bayezid and his sons attempted to make an
escape.

Why did Sparta Collapse?

Sparta was an ancient Greek City state. Sparta was the leading force of the unified Greek military during the Greco-Persian Wars.  Sparta was also the principal rival and then enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War. The city of Sparta never recovered from  the defeat against Thebes in the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC.

Special Thanks for the Script to : Joshua Potts

Records from July of 1941 estimate that the American Army had a strength of 174,000 soldiers. If you include the 1.2 million men forcefully drafted into the military, then we can see that the US had about the 17th largest army in the world.
The American Army was at its largest in March of 1945, and most recruits went on to serve in the Ground Forces.

Why did the Portuguese Empire collapse?

Portugal gained possessions in India, the East Indies, and Brazil. Besides the footholds in some parts of the world, Portugal was a country that discovered other places and establish trade routes to China and Japan. And their empire will start to exist as scarcely empire. It was a commercial operation based on possession of fortifications and posts strategically situated for trade. Portugal didn't focus on attacking and gaining tons of land from Oriental Kingdoms due to the probably the lack of necessary manpower and the huge distance to do so. the Portuguese also relied on alliances with native states and didn't dominate the Indian Ocean due to it's vastness, but managed to establish strongholds to assure a trade network.

Wikipedia : ""The Hittites (/ˈhɪtaɪts/) were an Anatolian people who played an important role in establishing an empire centered on Hattusa in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC. This empire reached its height during the mid-14th century BC under Suppiluliuma I, when it encompassed an area that included most of Anatolia as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia.

Between the 15th and 13th centuries BC, the Empire of Hattusa, conventionally called the Hittite Empire, came into conflict with the Egyptian Empire, Middle Assyrian Empire and the empire of the Mitanni for control of the Near East. The Assyrians eventually emerged as the dominant power and annexed much of the Hittite empire, while the remainder was sacked by Phrygian newcomers to the region. After c. 1180 BC, during the Bronze Age collapse, the Hittites splintered into several independent ""Neo-Hittite"" city-states, some of which survived until the 8th century BC before succumbing to the Neo-Assyrian Empire.""

The Turks were migrants, coming from Asia. They gained control of the Arab-Iranian empire and sacked  important centers in the Armenian highlands and eastern Anatolia. The internal problems and the degradation of the Byzantine Empire encouraged this population to advance further without any real resistance, culminating in the famous Battle of Manzikert. Then Turks were free to settle all across the region, dominating it by military might and intermixing with local populations.
The decline of the Byzantines led to the grow of Seljuk turks which expanded. And from 11th to 14th century many turkish beyliks existed.

At its largest territorial extent, in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth covered almost (1,000,000 km2 of land and on this land lived a multi-ethnic population around of 11 million. You may think it wasn't so much but at that time, it was pretty large population. It was still a powerful country at the start of 18th century but at the end the century, it was wiped from the map. There was no Poland nor Lithuania.

China, a country with a rich past was ruled by many dynasties across their history. The Chinese civilization was one of the greatest of the Ancient World, and from that time until 1911, they were ruled by different families and groups.

We can say that in this era of Qing some very good things happened. The population grew from some 150 million to 450 million, the integrated national economy was established. In 1689 a treaty was concluded with Russia at Nerchinsk establishing the northern extent of the Manchurian boundary at the Argun River. Over the next years Mongols were defeated, and the empire was extended to Outer Mongolia, Tibet,  Turkistan, and Nepal. 

The fall and collapse of the Qing dynasty were caused by external and internal changes within and outside the dynasty. The next rulers, however, were unable to meet the problems caused by increased population pressure and concentration of land ownership. The Manchu armies deteriorated, popular unrest happened and the situation was aggravated even more by severe floods, famine and by the wars they lost against the western powers.
