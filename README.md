# Exploratory Data Analysis using Youtube Video Data from Different Types of Content Channels

## 1. Objectives and Idea Background

### 1.1 - Idea Brackground:
The mainly idea behind this project is to understand better how to use EDA and get to know better about Youtube API, and since Youtube has a huge amount of data being produced on a daily basis it is a excellent starting point. Youtube is also the second most used search engine in the World, almost 3 billion searches per day, and the famous Youtube Algorithm is surronded by a lot of mystery, so understand the data behind views, comments, likes, etc, could give a lot of information, about the truth

### 1.2 - Objectives
This project has the following objectives:
- The principal aim of this project is to get to know better the Youtube API and how to get data from Youtube
- To obtain this objective we will look from 6 science channels: 
    - Science channels:
        - Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell, Veritasium, Knowledgia, Anatomy Zone, Numberphile, Physics Girl
   

- With this we want to ask and we will try to answer specifics questions:
    - How does the science channels performs compared with each other?
    - Specific subjects(Physics, History, Math, etc) channels has less or more engagement compared to the more wide ones, like Veritasium and Kurzgesagt
    - The comments and likes in a video/channel really matters in the amount of views?
    - The video duration matters in terms of Likes?
    - How often channels with more views/likes/comments upload videos, it matters?

- Explore the trending topics using NLP techniques
    - Which topics are more like to being covered in some of those science videos (e.g. using wordcloud for video titles)?
    - Which questions are being asked in the comment sections in the videos of Science Channels



### 1.3 - Steps of the Project
1. Obtain the video meta data from the channels listed above
2. Preprocess data and engineer aditional features for analysis
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Conclusion
