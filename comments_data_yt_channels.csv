Without this context, nothing else matters:  identity itself, in general, cannot exist.  Unfortunately, this context, right now, has problems that are not fully recognised and understood - and I'm really annoyed because no-one in academia seems interested in even finding out what I've recognised through my own 20 years of study - (I've talked to a couple of experts over the years, but they have all since retired).  (I started with recognising problems with understanding a type of computer game as a matter of linguistics, only to realise that the problem that was causing all of this, and far more, ran as deep as it gets.)\n\nAs with everything involving language, there will always be a feedback-loop at the root of everything, but sets and numbers are not really it, for either/both.  Above the most basic loop, however, the real semantic context that matters for numbers, and indeed everything else in relation to things, are properties they have.  The key to understanding identities of properties vs the individual identities of things themselves, is that properties only exist in RELATION, and are therefore a matter of comparison.  Numbers inherently exist within this context, and is where we must begin.\n\nThere's obviously a whole lot more I could go into here, but, again, without the current foundation being what it needs to be, we'll run into problems eventually.  (The currently used foundation of human recognition and understanding does not truly allow for any of it to exist at all.)"", ""Not a lot of people mentioning it, but I liked the bit at the end that I could understand XD. It's interesting to think of the mammoths as sets, not just numbers. Cuz he's right, even before we consider numbers and quantities, we are pattern recognition machines. \n\nWe had to be able to classify that as a friend and that as a relevant mammoth (one that isn't too far or abnormally strong or whatever) and that thing over there as neither one.\n\nThat said, apparently, the philosophy of how to code those patterns is way beyond me haha""]"

When someone paints a picture or composes a symphony or makes a film, nobody asks if it\'s useful. Why ask that question about this? Can\'t we just appreciate its beauty?\n\nAnd then the second answer (which would have been a great disappointment to Hardy), which is that this sort of mathematics lies at the heart of the cryptography that protects all our digital communications. Without mathematicians exploring these sorts of questions, following their curiosity, modern cryptography would not have been possible, and all your electronic banking and other secure communication would have been impossible.\n\nWhen I was a postdoc in mathematics, working (not very successfully) in an area of mathematics where you could draw a clear link to physics and chemistry and materials science, and therefore at least somewhat possible to justify as ""useful"", we used to mock the number theorists for being *really* useless and irrelevant. And now their work is inside every phone and computer on the planet, billions of them.\n\nIdeas that seemed totally useless for decades or even centuries turned out to be extremely useful in the right real-world context.

There needs to be some other factor with units of mass to make kg disappear. What is it?"", 'Four questions, an observation and a suggested topic:\n\nQuestions:\n1) Diffusion? The relatively fresh river water must take up salt from the ocean and thus become more dense with time. Thus, the g\' term must grow smaller. Also, chemical and micro-pollutants must disperse. Eventually, an identifiable current must fade away.\n2) Temperature? Diffusion rates will have a temperature dependency. Colder water will be more dense; warmer water will be less dense. Again, g\' is affected. Again, pollutant dispersion is affected. Inevitable heat transfer will normalize the temperatures. Thus, again, g\' will change over distance.\n3) What role does momentum transfer serve? The velocity of the river will inevitably be transferred to the more quiescent sea. The velocity difference will promote slowing, mixing, and broadening of the initial ""jet"" of incoming river water. Not only the volume of incoming water, but its velocity will play a role. Is the apparent absence of momentum transfer consideration another simplifying assumption?\n4) What useful purpose do your calculations serve? Repeatedly, direct measurements are cited. Being you have the real data, why perform the assumption-laden approximate calculations? I can understand academic interest (I like to play with numbers too). Is making a mathematical model the sole purpose for your PhD?\n\nObservation:\n\nThe sea in the area studied is not very deep. Doggerland is not far below the surface.

It is the difference between data and metadata. \n\nEssentially, the axiom  used to perpetuate the infinite loop is ambiguous and should be read to reaffirm the statement is necessarily false, as per the original premise, rather than to intentionally contradict the original premise. So the assumption of the statement being false is reaffirmed by the axiom that ""a provable statement must be true"", not contradicted by it. You choose to overlook that the statement bears witness to its own fallacy and that is the final state.  Instead of terminating the evaluation of state, the state is unnecessarily reapplied and the statement erroneously reevaluated. So you choose to loop infinitely because the logic state of the previous evaluation is not accepted by you as a final state but fed back and reevaluated (incorrectly). The same applies if you presume the statement to be true. \n\nAn infinite loop in logic is just another variant of Zenos paradoxes, which are  logical fallacies. involving violations of axioms.

I'm a lawyer, not a mathematician. And this is also why my proof follows no standard format.\r\n\r\nThe sum of any two integers where one is even and one is odd will always sum to an integer which can be expressed as 4K + 1.\r Because they can never sum to 4K + 3, any 4K + 3 prime could never be solved by x² + y².\n\r\nExcept for 2, all prime integers are odd integers. The sum of any two integers is only an odd integer when one integer is even and one is odd. An even integer is always divisible by 2. These are fundamental and do not require proof. Similarly, the square of any even number is divisible by 4: [N² = (2x)² = 2²x² = 4x²]. \n\nAs for the square of the odd number, if M is 1, then the sum of N² + M² = 4x² + 1. \rBut other than 1, all odd integers are an even integer +1. Thus, if M is an odd integer not equal to 1, then M = 2y +1. So M² = (2y + 1)² = 4y² + 4y + 1.\n\n\r\nThus, the sum of two squares, where one is even and the other is odd is: 4x² + 4y² + 4y + 1. And this can be factored to 4(x² + y² + y) + 1, or 4K + 1. This shows that the sum of two squares where one is an even number and one is odd will always take the form of 4K + 1. Thus only an odd prime which is in the form of 4K + 1 might be solved by the sum of two squares. But any prime number which is in the form 4K + 3 can have no sum of two squares solution.""]"

Does a photon transfer spatial curvature from one location to another? Wrap a piece of wire around a pencil and it can produce a 3D coil of wire, much like a spring. When viewed from the side it can look like a two-dimensional sine wave. You could coil the wire with either a right-hand twist, or with a left-hand twist. Could Planck\'s Constant be proportional to the twist cycles. A photon with a higher frequency has more energy. (More spatial curvature). What if gluons are actually made up of these twisted tubes which become entangled with other tubes to produce quarks. (In the same way twisted electrical extension cords can become entangled.) Therefore, the gluons are actually a part of the quarks. Mesons are made up of two entangled tubes (Quarks/Gluons), while protons and neutrons would be made up of three entangled tubes. (Quarks/Gluons) The ""Color Force"" would be related to the XYZ coordinates (orientation) of entanglement. ""Asymptotic Freedom"", and ""flux tubes"" make sense based on this concept. Neutrinos would be made up of a twisted torus (like a twisted donut) within this model. Gravity is a result of a very small curvature imbalance within atoms. (This is why the force of gravity is so small.) Instead of attempting to explain matter as ""particles"", this concept attempts to explain matter more in the manner of our current understanding of the space-time curvature of gravity. If an electron has qualities of both a particle and a wave, it cannot be either one. It must be something else. Therefore, a ""particle"" is actually a structure which stores spatial curvature. Can an electron-positron pair (which are made up of opposite directions of twist) annihilate each other by unwinding into each other producing Gamma Ray photons.\r\n\r\nDoes an electron travel through space like a threaded nut traveling down a threaded rod, with each twist cycle proportional to Planck’s Constant?  Does it wind up on one end, while unwinding on the other end?   Is this related to the Higgs field?  Does this help explain the strange ½ spin of many subatomic particles?  Does the 720 degree rotation of a 1/2 spin particle require at least one extra dimension?\r\n\r\n Alpha decay occurs when the two protons and two neutrons (which are bound together by entangled tubes), become un-entangled from the rest of the nucleons\r\n\r\n. Beta decay occurs when the tube of a down quark/gluon in a neutron becomes overtwisted and breaks producing a twisted torus (neutrino) and an up quark, and the ejected electron. The phenomenon of Supercoiling involving twist and writhe cycles may reveal how overtwisted quarks can produce these new particles.

If there are 100 doors and you pick #1 and Monty opens all the other doors except for door #37 (to follow this lady\'s example), YOU know that you were almost certainly WRONG when you picked door #1 and that switching to #37 is the way to go.  But suppose you pick door #1, Monty trims it down to #1 and #37, and then you walk away and hand the decision over to someone who was not there from the beginning.  All that new person knows is that there are two doors and the car is behind one of them.  THAT person has a 50/50 chance of getting it right.  The trick to understand the Monty Hall Problem is to NOT allow yourself to fall into the mindset of the ""new"" person who sees only 2 doors and has a 50/50 shot.  That new person has a 50/50 shot NOT because the car is 50% likely to be behind #1 and 50% likely to be behind #37, but rather it\'s 50/50 for the new person because the information he has access to is more limited than the information YOU have access to.  For the new person it is a case of Ceteris Perabus --  ""all things being equal"" -- there are no variables to favor one door over the other. It truly is a coin flip.  But for you, the original contestant, there ARE variables that favor one door over the other.  You have significantly more information than the ""new"" person and have better odds of winning the car.  BUT.... the way that Monty reveals the losing doors to you one by one kinda screws with your head.  He\'s doing you a favor, but it FEELS like he\'s teasing you to make it more tense and dramatic.  That\'s the rub.  \n\nFor years I was convinced that the odds for the original contestant HAD to be 50/50 when down to 2 doors regardless of the original number of doors, because ""why would the odds for me be different than the odds for someone else who stepped in to take my place at the last minute? I mean, the car is in one of  only two places, right?""  I was ready to die on that hill.  Shifting your thinking to that of the ""replacement"" contestant is quite understandable.  \n\nFinally someone put in perspective for me. He said the thing that screws your thinking up is that all those extra doors are opened BEFORE you are given the option to switch.  If Monty let you pick one door of a hundred and then said, ""You picked your door.  Would you like instead to switch to the entire set of doors you did NOT pick?  Keep your present door, or switch to ALL of the other doors at once.""  THAT is essentially what he offers you in this game, except he plays with your mind by not giving you that choice until the end.  He was gonna open all those other losing doors anyway, so it was just an issue of if he\'d open them before or after he made you the switch offer.\n\n""There are three doors.  No matter which you pick you are more likely to be wrong than right. So do you want to stick with the choice that is probably wrong or switch to the set of every remaining door instead?""  THAT\'S the game.  The odds are ALWAYS in your favor from the very beginning, because after all the game show WANTS you to win.  The more often people win, the more exciting the show, the higher the ratings, the more sponsors will donate their products as prizes, etc.\n\nA casino would prefer you lose, but a game show would prefer you win. \n\nWas it a bit humbling to find out I was wrong for years and years about that Monty Hall Problem?  Yes.  But the enlightenment in finally seeing it the correct way was even better.']"

What if I can show that this is not the case? \r\nThe line segment has two ends where it terminates. Those ends, whether theoretical or graphically displayed, by definition are demarcated each by a point, part of those of which the line segment is composed. Beyond those two points in the respective directions away from the two ends, there cannot be additional points or the line segment ends/terminations could not be defined. So, we know then that the last point must be that by which each end is terminated. Now each end of the line segment is a very particular location in space, each to the other and must be definitively demarcated that there might be that termination or a line segment at all. If that is so, it demands that some aspect of these end points be asserted that each end of the line segment is defined by them. For example, it could not be the center of the points (which is not supposed to be defined or the point would have scope and dimension) or the distance from that center to the outside edge would mean that the line segment was actually longer than demarcated. So, the end of the line must be by definition, defined by the outside edge of each of those points, by which there must be a side opposite and thus a middle. Therefore, these points necessarily have scope and dimension and there cannot be an infinite number of them along that line segment. \r\nHere, it is the logic of the means of defining the line segment to begin with/at all which must be contradicted to claim that there are infinite points along its finite length and that clearly cannot be so.

If the two nearby rational fractions are about say 10^-5 apart, there should be a 1/10 probability that the random number is closer to one of them than 10^-6 and a 1/100 probability that it comes closer than 10^-7 etc.\nThe smallest distance from rational fraction I have found so far for a combination of irrational numbers is for:\nsqrt(2)+cuberoot(2)+cuberoot(3) which is only 1.78442x10^-09 away from (more than) 4+103/885\nthe 2nd lowest difference I found for:\ne+pi+ln(2) which is only 2.15747x10^-09 less than 6+485/877\nThe biggest distances (with very simple rational fractions!) I found was for:\n[ln(pi)]^3 which is 6.1496x10^-05 more than 1.5\n[ln(2)]^3 which was 3.0868x10^-04 less than 1/3\nI just thought someone watching this channel might find these irrational curiosities interesting!"", 'well 7 it is😀', 'So a thumbnail of this video in a previous video and thought to myself ""Is that Walter White?""', 'I consciously think ""....well, yeah, but I can\'t pick 7""', 'Modelling gasses sounds like a really camp way to fart.

Only the French contributed to breaking the Enigma.\r\nThey provided technical drawings of the machine, which they bought from a German industrialist. It was not necessary, at that time Poles were already successfully decoding German correspondence.\r\nRealizing the importance of reading German correspondence and knowing about the inevitability of the outbreak of war, Polish intelligence organized a conference to which it invited the French and the British.\r\nIn the summer of 1939, i.e. just before the outbreak of WWII, at this meeting, the Poles handed over all their materials about the Enigma and working decoding machines to the French and British intelligence. Free, for nothing. Poles did not want any commitments to anything - in my opinion it was a huge mistake - from my experience I know that when you get something for free, the recipient will never appreciate such a gift, as history has shown, in this case it was similar.\r\nI do not know where these lies that the Americans helped to break the Enigma, they are brazen, the Americans have never worked on the Enigma.\r\nThey got the Enigma from the British much later, it is worth noting that they never solved any problems with it. The British also did not understand the operation of the Enigma. They got all the materials and underwent training in Poland, but still did not understand its operation.\r\nFor example, before the fascists entered France, the Germans changed the rotors / rollers. The British who, since receiving Enigma from Polish intelligence, decrypted German dispatches, suddenly could not read any. It was only when they reached the UK that Polish mathematicians who had previously understood the operation of Enigma showed them what to do in a situation when the Germans changed the rotors / rollers in the machine.\r\nThe British not only did not help Poland in 1939, although a treaty on mutual assistance in the event of an attack by another state was signed, they never even thanked the Poles for handing over the decoding machine, they even behaved very brazenly claiming that the Poles had to steal the machine.\r\nThey have never figured out how the Enigma works on their own and in their vain, empty heads it could not be understood that someone could be better than them, achieve what they did not manage to achieve. This attitude was mainly the responsibility of the then chief of British intelligence. (big asshole)\r\nLet me remind you that many battles were won thanks to decoded messages. For example, by reading the messages sent by U-Boats, it was known where to send the flying boats to destroy German submarines.\r\nHad it not been for the achievement of Polish mathematicians, the Second World War would have lasted much longer, perhaps its result would have been different and in Europe we would all speak German today ... sic !!!\r\n\r\nThe British and Americans sold Poland first to Hitler, leaving Poland alone, without help when the fascists invaded Poland in 39, and then to Stalin.\r\nI am curious how it will be with Putin, there is no point in counting on the whole of NATO, I am convinced that the Germans will unscrupulously stab us in the back. In order to continue receiving cheaper gas from Russia, the Germans will enter us with their tanks and attack Polish troops from the rear.\r\nAs much as I want to write that it is a pity that Polish pilots fought and died in defense of the UK in 303 and other squadrons. It was thanks to these brave people that it was possible to win the war for air control over England, which prevented the fascists from invading the UK. Hitler did not want to risk landing before gaining complete air control.\r\nThe Poles statistically knocked down the most German planes, despite the fact that they were included in the fight relatively late. They flew more aggressively, opened fire from their rifles only from a closer distance, and thanks to that their shooting results were much better. Later, they trained the British in the so-called ""Polish flying school"".\r\nThey also never thanked for that.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone has heard or read the phrase ""Never before have so many owe so much, so few,"" said Churchill on August 20, 1940 in the lower house of the British Parliament. Unfortunately, this does not apply to the Poles in any way, before that date none of the Polish squadrons had yet entered the fight, in his speech Churchill thanked only British fighter and bomber pilots ""... he goes to British pilots who, undaunted by adversities, ... "".\r\nThey\'re a terrible nation ... they won\'t help, and if you do something better, they\'ll lie about you, they won\'t admit they were wrong, and they\'ll never, ever say thank you.\r\nIt is a truly scary nation ... \n\nPrzestańcie tak bezczelnie kłamać \r\nTylko polskich trzech matematyków złamało kod Enigmy i wyłącznie oni, nikt im nie pomagał a w szczególności nie byli to brytyjczycy czy amerykanie, wątpię czy ci drudzy w tym czasie o Enigmie mieli jakiekolwiek pojęcie. Tylko Francuzi mieli wkład w złamanie Enigmy.\r\nDostarczyli rysunki techniczne maszyny, które kupili od niemieckiego przemysłowca. Nie było to niezbędne, w tym czasie Polacy już dekodowali z sukcesami niemiecką korespondencję.\r\nZdając sobie sprawę jak ważne jest odczytywanie niemieckiej korespondencji oraz wiedząc o nieuchronności wybuchu wojny, Polski wywiad zorganizował konferencję na którą zaprosił francuzów i brytyjczyków.\r\nLatem 1939 roku czyli tuż przed wybuchem II WW na tym spotkaniu Polacy przekazali wszystkie swoje materiały o Enigmie oraz działające maszyny dekodujące wywiadowi Francuskiemu i Brytyjskiemu. Za darmo, za nic. Polacy nie chcieli żadnych zobowiązań do czegokolwiek - moim zdaniem to był ogromny błąd - z mojego doświadczenia wiem że gdy coś się dostaje za darmo, to obdarowany nigdy nie doceni takiego prezentu, jak pokazała historia w tym wypadku było podobnie.\r\nNie wiem skąd te kłamstwa że Amerykanie pomagali przy złamaniu Enigmy, są one bezczelne, Amerykanie nigdy nie pracowali nad Enigmą.\r\nDostali Enigmę od brytyjczyków znacznie później, warto zaznaczyć że nigdy nie rozwiązali żadnych z nią problemów. Brytyjczycy również nie rozumieli działania Enigmy. Dostali wszystkie materiały i przeszli w Polsce szkolenie lecz nadal nie rozumieli jej działania.\r\nPrzykładowo, przed wkroczeniem faszystów na terytorium Francji, Niemcy zmienili wirniki/walce. Brytyjczycy którzy od czasu otrzymania Enigmy od Polskiego wywiadu deszyfrowali niemieckie depesze nagle nie mogli żadnej odczytać. Dopiero gdy dotarli do UK Polscy matematycy którzy wcześniej zrozumieli działanie Enigmy pokazali im co robić w sytuacji gdy Niemcy zmieniają w maszynie wirniki/walce.\r\nBrytyjczycy nie tylko nie pomogli Polsce w 1939 roku mimo że był podpisany traktat o wzajemnej pomocy w przypadku ataku innego państwa, to nawet nigdy nie podziękowali Polakom za przekazanie maszyny dekodującej, wręcz zachowali się bardzo bezczelnie twierdząc że Polacy musieli ukraść maszynę. \r\nSami nigdy nie doszli jak działa Enigma i w ich próżnych, pustych głowach nie mieściło się że ktoś może być od nich być lepszy, osiągnąć to czego im się nie udało. Za tą postawę głównie odpowiada najbardziej ówczesny szef wywiadu brytyjskiego.   (wielki dupek)\r\nPrzypomnę że dzięki dekodowanym depeszom udało się wygrać wiele bitew. Np. odczytując depesze wysyłane przez U-Boats wiedziano gdzie wysłać latające łodzie aby zniszczyły niemieckie okręty podwodne.\r\nGdyby nie osiągnięcie polskich matematyków, Druga Wojna Światowa trwała by znacznie dłużej, być może jej wynik byłby inny i w Europie wszyscy mówilibyśmy dziś po niemiecku ... sic!!!\r\n\r\nBrytyjczycy i Amerykanie sprzedali Polskę najpierw Hitlerowi zostawiając Polskę samą, bez pomocy gdy faszyści najechali na Polskę w 39, a później Stalinowi. \r\nJestem ciekaw jak będzie z Putinem, na całe NATO nie ma co liczyć, jestem przekonany że niemcy bez skrupułów wbiją nam nóż w plecy. Aby nadal otrzymywać tańszy gaz z rosji niemcy wjadą do nas swoimi czołgami i zaatakują od tyłu polskie oddziały.\r\nAż chce się napisać że szkoda iż Polscy piloci walczyli i umierali w obronie UK w dywizjonach lotniczych 303 oraz innych. To dzięki tym dzielnym ludziom udało się wygrać wojnę o panowanie w powietrzu nad Anglią co uniemożliwiło faszystom najechanie UK. Hitler nie chciał ryzykować desantu przed uzyskaniem całkowitego panowania w powietrzu. \r\nPolacy statystycznie strącili najwięcej niemieckich samolotów, mimo że dość późno zostali włączeni do walki. Latali bardziej agresywnie, otwierali ogień z karabinów dopiero z bliższej odległości i dzięki temu ich wyniki zestrzeleń były znacznie lepsze. Później szkolili brytyjczyków w tzw. ""polskiej szkoły latania"".\r\nZa to też nigdy nie podziękowali. \r\n\r\nMoże ktoś słyszał lub czytał takie zdanie ""Jeszcze nigdy tak wielu, nie zawdzięczało tak wiele, tak nielicznym"" - to powiedział Churchill 20 sierpnia 1940 w izbie niższej brytyjskiego parlamentu. Niestety nie odnosi się to w żadnym stopniu do Polaków, przed tą datą żaden z polskich dywizjonów jeszcze nie wszedł do walki, w przemówieniu Churchill dziękował wyłącznie brytyjskim pilotom myśliwców i bombowców ""... kieruje się ku brytyjskim lotnikom, którzy, niezrażeni przez przeciwności, ..."" .\r\nTo straszny naród ... nie pomogą, a jeśli coś robisz lepiej to będą kłamać na Twój temat, nie przyznają się do błędu i nigdy ale to nigdy nie podziękują.\r\nTo na prawdę prawdziwie straszny naród ...', 'The Chicago Science Museum has an example plucked from a submarine of the code book, it is weighted with lead so it will sink in water.

Essentially, I can have somebody pull a card, put it on top of the pile, and within at least 6 shuffles, you can use 1:1 shuffles to place their card anywhere within the deck by converting the number into binary and doing a sequence if in/out shuffles accordingly.  What denotes an ""in"" shuffle, is where the top card is the one moving into the deck, and an ""out"" shuffle is keeping the top and bottom cards the same with this 1:1 shuffle.

662,uzkD5SeuwzM,"['Hey Everybody! So this video is a remake and remaster of an older video that has a mistake in it. You can watch the original here: https://youtu.be/ZL4yYHdDSWs\nWhat is the mistake? In a nutshell: In the original video we said that it was PHYSICALLY impossible to leave the local group and reach other galaxy groups. That the rest of the universe is moving away from us too fast to catch up. But that’s wrong. It is not PHYSICALLY impossible to leave the Local Group, just extremely unlikely that we’ll ever do it. \nBUT: If you have a lot of time and a fast spaceship you can still get to a limited amount of galaxies – these galaxies will eventually get out of reach forever but until then, they are technically within reach. So why did we keep the video up and didn’t purge it when we deleted our addiction and refugee crisis videos?\nWell, it has to do with the nature and severity of the mistake: We did talk to a few astrophysicists to ask them what they thought and if we should take down the video. Their feedback was pretty clear, they thought it was still fine as the universe expansion things explained in the video are correct and they didn’t consider the local group thing as too major. This was actually a case of “good enough”. \nAlso, back when this original upload happened, Kurzgesagt was operating at pretty tight margins and just redoing a video was not easy for us. Back then the team was small and we were fighting to put new videos out. So we just swallowed the bitter pill and kept the video around.\nBut the video still bothered us, as far as we know this was the biggest unfixed mistake on the channel. Super frustrating, especially because the core idea of the video is so fascinating. The limit of our species. The actual limit. So yeah, we finally remade the video, sorry for taking this long, life got in the way.\nThe original video will stay up, you can compare the two if you want to see how far we have come in a few years in terms of production quality. All in all, we could only grow the channel and work on getting better because of direct support from you guys. So thank you for that. – Philipp\n\nPS: If you want, check out our shop for some new posters about the universe posters and black hole plushies and stuff like that: https://bit.ly/3dRJj71', 'That’s social security code…😊', 'My god, space is so cool but sooo terrifying', '亜光速の宇宙船が実現するなら、いずれ地球から永遠に引き離されるとわかっていても他の銀河群を目指す者が現れるのだろうか。\n永遠の独立と無限の資源を求めて、、、。\n\n仮に観測可能な宇宙に地球以外で生命が存在しないという仮説が正しければ、少なくとも見渡す限りの星空は全て人類の物、、、', 'Maybe there were aliens but our universe us just like a bug galaxy and other galaxies went so far that its unobservable so aliens too cant see us .', 'Hii i just wanna know how are you making this animations???', 'I’m gifting my first 20 subscribers.', ""i feel like humans trying to come up with wild sh!t to explain the start of the universe is like a single celled organisim attempting to explain to me how the large hydron collider works\n\nthe human mind, fundamentally, CANNOT EVER comprehened the nature of the universe?\n\nwhy?\n\nbecause we evolved to live as competitive hunters of meat and plants.  and that took literally most of the universe's existence to happen.  we can only understand, percieve, and comprhened a microscopic fraction of the real scope and majesty of our universe.  and technology will not get us very far tbh.\n\nmaybe evolution can happen rapidly with the help of an intellegent influence but I doubt it.  if we can even change the nature of our own brains we still have to PERCIEVE THE FUNDAMENTALLY IMPERCEPTABLE\n\nit will never happen.  doesnt mean we shouldnt try of course but I just wanna be one of the first to say it."", 'wait, if the galaxies mix together  wont all the shit in the galaxies crash together and like destroy earth and other colonised planets', 'Worm holes and black holes have a theory that they can teleport us the where ever we want that has a worm hole']"

We underestimated the necessary work load and all the potential problems tenfold – this is not a figure of speech, this took ten times longer than we thought it would. And we are sort of used to working on big projects. So the first update to the app should hopefully be here in the next 24 hours (we are waiting for approval of the update in the app stores) – it will fix a bunch of small things that slipped through. We’ll constantly improve this thing because while it was honestly a horrible nightmare to make, it also was fun and we want to get better at it and make more things in the future. In case you don’t know Wait but Why btw, it is the best and most fun blog on the internet (https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/universe.html) and if you don’t know it you should change that like right now. Tim and I collaborated for the first time in 2013 and we have been good friends ever since. And this thing was something we started talking about years ago.\nSo what is this thing we made and why? You can seamlessly travel from the smallest things in existence, past the coronavirus, human cells and dinosaurs all the way to the largest stars and galaxies and marvel at the whole observable universe. You can learn more about each object or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it all. It’s a fun plaything. The app is inspired by the “scale of the universe” website by the Huang Twins that Tim and I spent a lot of time with when it came out years ago – and felt that it was finally time to create a Wait but Why and Kurzgesagt version.\nThere are no in-app purchases and no ads. All future updates are included! Since this is our first app we would love to hear your feedback so we can improve it over time. Leave us a five star review if you want to support it.

Something different today, make sure to watch it to the end! \nJohn Green is reading one of his reviews of our modern world, from his Podcast The Anthropocene Reviewed, which you should check out! https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed\nI haven't said this often enough publicly, but John and Hank Green, the Vlogbrothers and first generation science Youtubers are the reason Kurzgesagt exists today. In the very literal sense, that when I saw the first episode of Crash Course World History as a student in university I decided to try to do something similar. Doing Kurzgesagt was very hard for the first few years, for a variety of reasons. What made it easier was the kind advice and real world help we got from John and Hank to make this channel work and not burn out. Over the years we became friends – and to me the genuine nature of their work is still inspiring. My team and I try to do the same with Kurzgesagt. To be driven by the values we believe in and not by the outside world. \nSo when John asked me if we maybe would illustrate and animate one of his essays, it was an easy yes. This is the result and we hope you like it.

It's the longest living animals that need to worry about something that'll take 10 years to grow, because they might still be alive to deal with it when it starts to cause problems. Short lived animals also have faster metabolisms, because they NEED to grow fast enough to reproduce, so metabolic rate also plays a factor.

690,WPPPFqsECz0,"[""Ohai! For a change a few personal words. My name is Philipp and I started this channel almost seven years ago – you don’t know my voice but you have heard my words because I write most of our scripts.  Oh boy. This was a hard video to make. Gratitude felt vaguely risky to do as a topic. It has this aura of cheap Instagram hashtag self help stuff.   Some of you will hate this video deeply, and the thought of that made me pretty anxious writing it. Gratitude was not supposed to be a video topic originally. Just like the Nihilism and Loneliness videos, the script was based on personal struggles and part of the process of dealing with them. And so it felt right to make gratitude a video too.  But Kurzgesagt is not a self help channel, so we'll keep this sort of content at roughly one or two per year.   We hope they are helpful to some of you.   If you care for my take on how to practice Gratitude, we made a Kurzgesagt Gratitude journal to combine the science with practical tips. https://shop.kurzgesagt.org/ Edit: PRE-ORDER is available again.  Please note: You don’t need to buy this or anything else to practice gratitude – you only need a pen, a piece of paper and 5 minutes.   Thank you for watching our videos and reading this comment.

In a nutshell: It is not PHYSICALLY impossible to leave the Local Group as we said in this version. It is just extremely unlikely that we’ll ever do it, even for the standards of our videos.\nBUT: If you have a lot of time and a fast spaceship you can still fly to a limited amount of galaxies – these galaxies will eventually get out of reach forever but until then, they are within reach. Although every second some of them escape us forever.\n\nOk, if this is so why did we keep the video up and not purge it when we deleted our addiction and refugee crisis videos? Well, it has to do with the nature and severity of the mistake: This mistake was much more straight forward then with the other two videos, so we did talk to a few astrophysicists to ask them what they thought and if we should take down the video. Their feedback was pretty clear, they thought it was still fine as the universe expansion things explained in the video are correct and they didn’t consider the local group thing as too major. This was actually a case of “good enough”.\n\nAlso, back when this original upload happened, Kurzgesagt was operating at pretty tight margins and just redoing a video was not easy for us. Back then the team was small and we were fighting to put new videos out. So we just swallowed the bitter pill and kept the video around.\n\nBut the video still bothered us, as far as we know this was the biggest unfixed mistake on the channel. Super frustrating, especially because the core idea of the video is so fascinating. The limit of our species. The actual limit. So yeah, we finally remade the video, sorry for taking this long, life got in the way.\n\nThe original video will stay up, you can compare the two if you want to see how far we have come in a few years in terms of production quality. All in all, we could only grow the channel and work on getting better because of direct support from you guys.

Work is the change of energy. So in our system the change of KE between 2 points is the work between them (remember the total is consonant). And since any increase in KE comes from PE for TE to remain consonant. The work W describes how much PE was converted to KE from point 1 to point 2.\n\nFrom this you get that power is just the rate of this transfer (how fast it was) by dividing over the time from point 1 to point 2."", 'im studying for a AP physics test, and this was so so so so so so so so so helpful, ur amazing thank you', ""You're so cool and pretty.

This is wrong, because first of all, to have a circular motion you must have a centripetal force, which means Not all forces must balance out. Second, there is always the right velocity for every angle, except of course for 90 degree angles. That means that there is NOT just one perfect angle as you are implying in this video, but there is a perfect velocity for any given angle. And Thirdly and most importantly, if there is no gravity there is no centripetal force, no matter the angle. Hence, the circular motion does not depend on the angle, but on the gravity, literally. See for yourself, if  Fc=mg x tan then if g=0 the Fc=0 no matter the angle. Angle is only important to adjust the initial velocity with which you enter the ring, that assuming there is no friction will then allow you to continue moving in circular motions.

Back then, there were experiments that physicists agreed were potentially going to be HUGE for modern physics - discovering the Higgs boson (we did that recently!), taking the first image of a black hole (we just did that too!). But a really big experiment was aiming to measure gravitational waves, and I remember being told we didn’t know if we’d measure them any time soon, if ever. But in 2015 we measured the first gravitational wave. It was a HUGE moment! Not just for physics, but for all of science! And the observatory that made the discovery was LIGO. For this video, which is part of a PBS space series that i’ll explain more in the description, I GOT TO GO TO LIGO. The best part was sitting with the head of the observatory and asking him all my questions about the universe in the downtime of the shoot. One of the coolest days of my life. Anyways..

867,wqH1F96OBWo,"['Some people in the comments (hey people!) have stated the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed due to aeroelastic flutter rather than resonance. I found this idea really interesting and it took me down a rabbit hole of nuanced physics.\xa0\n\nThere’s a common misconception that the bridge collapsed because of resonance in a particular way. Namely, that the wind pushed, then stopped, then pushed, then stopped at just the right rate to match the natural frequency of the bridge. This did not happen.\xa0\n\nWhat happened is that relatively steady wind pushed on the bridge, the elastic properties of the bridge caused the bridge to twist/sway, and that process repeated, and occurred at the natural frequency of the bridge. This is an example of a process called self-oscillation, and the self-oscillation that resulted was at the natural frequency of the bridge. This is quite different from “forced resonance” where the driving force is at the same frequency as the natural frequency of the system. The question I’m considering is whether the bridge scenario can be considered a type of resonance. We call it “resonance” when you blow into a bottle and it whistles. In that situation, there’s no periodic driver. There’s a constant force, just like with the bridge.\xa0\n\nSome of you mentioned MinutePhysics’s video on this. I’ve texted Henry!

Why do speakers with fairly small magnets driven with a vacuum tube amplifier, produce more bass, than a transistor power amp driving speakers with large magnets and stronger magnetic fields.  At the resonant frequency of the speaker, the speaker cone and voice coil are out of phase by about 90 degrees of the voltage driving them.  Tube amplifiers attempt to supply a current proportional to the input signal voltage, (to the amp),... because the current is maximum when the voltage crosses the zero voltage crossing, and the older style tube amps with coupling transformer, and lower negative feedback, have a lower damping factor, the bass at the resonant frequency comes through fine, even though the speaker exhibits it\'s highest resistance at the resonant frequency.  In a  transistor amp where the output voltage tends to follow precisely the input voltage, the 90 degrees out of phase signal at bass resonance to the speaker, provides negative feedback to the speaker, just as the cone is going towards it\'s maximum excursion,  and damps the speaker which ceases to be driven, and is beginning to generate a back electromotive force.  In addition, as the Voltage signal from the amp goes to zero, the current also drops to zero so the speakers motion in response also tries to go to zero.  Looking at the phase relationship when the output signal is highest, the mass of the speaker cone and voicecoil, has enough inertia as a whole, at low frequencies such that they are just starting to move, even though the voltage applied to them is at it\'s peak.  So even though two amps  (one tube, and the other transistor) may seem to have identical frequency response, and power driving a resistor, the tube amp, when checked with a microphone, will deliver more bass into a fairly resonant speaker, (high ""Q"") with identical voltage output (measured with the resistor load).  Transistor amps tend to always deliver the same voltage output as the input, while tube amps also show a loading effect, meaning the output voltage drops under load, and the voltage and current output will increase, (also out of phase) into a highly reactive load,.. this is also partly the result of how hysteresis in an output transformer can release energy, when the signal applied to it crosses through zero after having been driven to the point of ""charging"" the transformers iron core.  All in all The transistor amp behaves more like singing directly into the PVC pipe (pressure loading), versus singing across it, like it is a flute, which is more the way a vacuum tube amplifier would behave.']"

881,E1W72yddW64,"['⭐️ANSWER TO THE BONUS RIDDLE ⭐️\nThe first question? Mostly… no. Buckle up, this is a long answer. First of all, what humans can discern with their eyes is mostly only apparent brightness of a star (how bright the star looks. It’s an actual astronomy term). You can’t see really the color, and color is key. We’ll get to that in a second. \n\nSo, apparent brightness. Is it useful? Temperature of stars is loosely related to luminosity (another actual astronomy term. It’s like the “absolute brightness” of a star, or how much power, it’s outputting in all directions. Not just in the direction of your eye.) If you’re lucky and you’re seeing stars on the main sequence, oh, right. What’s the main sequence? \n\nThere’s a useful chart called the Hertzprung-Russell Diagram (google images it!) that shows temperature vs luminosity of stars. Temperature doesn’t necessarily correlate with luminosity. You’ve got these stars that are pretty normal and are on the “main sequence” that shows a linear-ish relationship between temperature and luminosity. Then there are other stars OFF the main sequence like Red Giants that are really bright but really cool. So you can’t necessarily count on temperature being related to luminosity. You ALSO can’t count on luminosity being related to apparent brightness, the thing you actually see, because stars appear dimmer when they are further away. You could have a really hot bright star far away and a really dim cool star close by and they would look the same brightness in the sky. So you can’t rely on brightness. Poop. \n\nYou can rely on color. You need to know the peak color of a star’s emission spectrum. That will tell you the temperature. Stars approximate black bodies which means that their peak wavelength correlates with their temperature. But the thing is, you can’t make out peak temperature with your naked eye because it’s emitting lots of colors even when it’s emitting the most of one color. So it ends up looking white. For example our star, our sun, we say it emits white light, but it actually peaks in green. \n\nSo to learn the temperature of a star, you need to measure its spectrum with a telescopey thing. But EVEN THEN you can’t necessarily tell which star is hottest based on the peak of the spectrum because some stars that are really far away are redshifted by really complicated effects from the expansion of the universe. Stars that are far away LOOK redder (if you could see the peak color of a star by looking). What you need to do then is look at detail in the spectrum, see where signature emission and absorption peaks are from elements like hydrogen, correct for redshift of the start to adjust the peak to the right color and THEN you can tell the temperature.

I have a comment about the explanation for tides. I have been unable to accept the explanation for tides that has existed since ... forever, and I\'m not comfortable with yours either. I can\'t see the Earth moving so quickly towards the moon that the ocean water can\'t keep up. After all, the depth of the oceans is miniscule relative to the diameter of the Earth. The average depth of the ocean is a mere 2 miles while the diameter of the Earth is 8000. I don\'t see how it\'s possible for a tidal force to create a measurable elongation over that last 2 miles, which is only .025% of the total. I would also think that the cohesion of the water molecules would overcome any such effect. Imagine this too: a balloon filled with ferrofluid sits around a globe in the center, representing the ocean around Earth. Now imagine swinging a magnet (representing the moon) around the balloon. What happens? I imagine that the balloon would become elongated, and that bulge would rotate around the globe. But there would be no matching bulge on the other side, would there? Instead, the balloon would be tight against the globe opposite the magnet. It should be that way with tides, but, of course, it isn\'t. Why? Where is the water\'s cohesion?

This maximum height for a given splash varies across the radii of the disk, as a function of the velocity and its mass as well; basically the kinetic energy of the droplet, 1/2(m)(v)(v). Ie. near the start of the video, the droplet\'s maximum splash value was closer to the center of impact for the droplet. Near the end of the video, the droplet\'s maximum splash value was near the fringe of the splash. (Ie. There is a point in time, when the droplet\'s splash height will be a single value across the disk\'s radius). The strength of the magnetic field across the disk can be shown in terms of the droplet\'s mass and velocity. This field strength seems to vary across any given radii for the disk, at impact (except the case where the droplet\'s splash exhibits a uniform height or when the peaks of the formed, ""splash needles""  have the same height. The variance in magnetic field\'s strength could therefore expressed using differential calculus. The measured values for the experiment would be the height where the droplet was released and the mass of the droplet, or it\'s kinetic energy.

899,oq6HFcFS2IE,"[""As promised, I’m posting my solutions to the magnet riddle and looking through your solutions (holy moly, lots of comments.) Breaking the magnet in half could work! But there’s the possibility of demagnetizing the metal by hitting it too hard. (It’s possible to MANGETIZE some metals by hitting them hard in a strong external magnetic field and DEMAGNETIZE them by hitting them hard. I don’t know how hard…) So I’d break bar A, test whether it sticks to bar B, if it does, then break bar B, and try sticking the A pieces to themselves and the B pieces to themselves. If none of them sticks, it was bar B. If A or B sticks to its own half, it’s that one.\n\nOther solutions I thought of that may or may not work: Similar to above, hitting the bars one by one and seeing whether they still stick (also thought up by Banane Dollar and others). Shaving off some pieces of iron, and seeing which bar they stick to. (alsothought up by +Wynchesster and many others) Moving a loop of wire connected to an ammeter near the magnet to see whether any current is produced. (If so that’s the magnet.)\n\nRuven Pinkhasov thought of the traditional (and my fav) solution to this riddle because it uses NO tools: move the bars orthogonal to each other forming a T shape. The non-magnet will feel a change along the length of the magnet, which have a weaker pulling the middle, and stronger toward the ends. This solution assumes the bars have a simple long-ways N-S configuration, but no matter the magnetization configuration, this method could work somehow. Also pros to Krekker Recer, Nipun Wahi and others!\n\nRavi Sharma thought of hanging the bars from a string and seeing which aligns with earth’s magnetic field. I don’t know if this would work in practice because it depends on the strength of the bar’s magnetization and the weight of the bars relative to torsional forces in the string. But in theory, it should work with a strong enough magnet in a strong enough external magnetic field. Props to Dan Kennedy, Abi Rozario and others for thinking of this.\n\nAdam Pearce, TANGENT PROPELLER and Kenny Maccormac and others would try heating the bars, then touching them (presumably after they've cooled again?) to see which one becomes unmagnetized after heating. They’d have to get pretty hot: beyond the Curie temperature of iron\n\nCreativity award goes to Valtteri Huuskonen who would use a phone manometer.

If we make the same choice for Maxwell's equation, then we have the possibility of a Vernam cipher which can convey information nonlocally. The thing which is conveyed is in the nature of a one-time pad rather than a true message or a book, and it does allow Bell's over-correlation.

1012,jyQwgBAaBag,"[""If you want more detail on the explanation here it is:\n1. The car is powered only by the wind. There is no motor or batteries of any kind.\n2. The propeller does NOT spin like a windmill. The wind does NOT push it and make it turn.\n3. Instead the wheels are geared to the propeller to turn it the opposite way, like a fan, so it pushes air backwards.\n4. To start the vehicle the wind simply pushes on the whole vehicle (like a block of styrofoam) and gets it moving.\n5. The wheels are turning so they turn the propeller in the opposite direction to how the wind is pushing it.\n6. The prop is pushing air back so air pushes the prop forwards, accelerating the car.\n7. Once you get up to wind speed there is no apparent wind on the vehicle. If the prop were spun like a windmill this would mean no more thrust. But, since the prop is operating like a fan, it still accelerates air backwards, generating thrust.\n8. You can go faster than wind speed continuously because even when going faster than the wind, the prop can still accelerate air backwards (in the car's frame of reference) generating thrust. In a stationary frame of reference you would see that the wind behind the propellor is slower than the surrounding air. So it's clear that the energy is coming from the wind.\n\nFAQ: If power is coming from the wheels to turn the prop, why doesn't that slow down the wheels more than it gets the prop to push back?\nA: Because the wheels are moving over the ground much faster than the prop is moving through the air (because there's a tailwind).\n\nExample:\xa0\nLet's say the car is going 12m/s in a 10m/s tailwind, so faster than the wind (note the prop will be moving through an apparent headwind of 2m/s).\n\nPower = Force x Velocity\n\nLet's say the chain applies a drag force of 100N on the wheels to drive the prop. This means we're taking power from the wheels = FxV = 100N x 12m/s = 1200W\n\nIf we apply this power to the fan, it can create a force of F = P/V = 1200W / 2m/s = 600N\n\nAdmittedly I've assumed no losses, but even if we waste half the power, we'd still get 300N of thrust which is more than the 100N of drag the prop adds to the wheels. The key is that we're harvesting power at higher speed, lower force, and deploying it at lower speed, higher force (which is only possible because we have a tailwind - in still air this wouldn't work because the relative velocity of the wheels over the ground would be exactly the same as the relative velocity of the prop through the air)."", 'This is so cool and kind of makes sense once you explain it. I sail so was basically applying that knowledge to this and it does start to make sense.', 'It appears to me that the propeller is creating lift in the forward direction, very similar to the sail in the sailboats that you were showing earlier. (the mechanism of lift is the same principle as that of an airplane wing, but it is just being directed in a different direction.) The operating principle is to create less pressure in one direction than there is in the opposite direction. A wing, regardless of which direction you direct it, will create lift. When it becomes a strong enough force to overcome the inertia, it will create additional lift in that direction. In an airplane, that force is directed up. But in the machine you demonstrated, it is directed in the direction you are already going, (i.e. forward) adding that force to the force of the wind. Cool demonstration.', ""That's amazing"", 'I wonder if this would also work with a Flettner rotor providing Magnus effect.

No, here\'s why:\nEither watch again from 8:28 or read what I\'ve written below...\n\nSpacetime is curved - it curves the opposite direction on the other side of the Earth.\xa0\n\nNeither us on this side of the Earth nor they on the other side are changing our spacial coordinates - we\'re not moving up, they\'re not moving down - Earth isn\'t flying into one of us.\n\nBUT we both ARE accelerating. In curved spacetime you have to accelerate just to remain stationary.\n\nThe traditional definition of acceleration is something changing its velocity.\n\nIn general relativity you have to embrace a new definition of acceleration: it means deviating from a geodesic - not going on a straight line path through spacetime. Near the Earth a geodesic is a parabola so unless you\'re moving in a parabolic arc (like on a zero-g plane) you are accelerating.\n\nThis definition is the same as the old one\xa0\xa0so if you\'re accelerating in deep space then your velocity is changing.\n\n*BUT*... if you are near a large mass you are in curved spacetime, now acceleration\xa0\xa0your velocity is changing. You can stay stationary relative to Earth\'s surface and still be accelerating. This is because your acceleration should be measured not relative to the Earth\'s surface but relative to free-falling objects - they are inertial observers.\n\nImagine this - I\'m in deep space and I make horizontal rows and rows of stationary golf balls. Then I hop in my rocket and accelerate up through them. Just think about what that looks like. Now my rocket is back on Earth just sitting there. I freeze time for a sec and make horizontal rows and rows of golf balls up into the atmosphere. Now unfreeze time. What do you see? If you just look at the golf balls and the rocket ship it looks the same as the situation in space where the golf balls were stationary and the rocket was accelerating. Einstein\'s point was the golf balls have the better claim as the ""stationary"" thing since their experience is just like the golf balls in deep space - no forces experienced. The rocket on Earth is just like the rocket in space. It feels a force and hence an acceleration.', 'first time in my life i understand NOTHING lol... sad', ""hey it's wonderfull how you answered each question i came up allong the video. at least almost. it went a little bit like this: so if you say the force of acceleration is caused by the deviation of a geodesic in what way are we moving while we stand on earth. and then you said we are stll moving in time. so that made me wonder, would that mean that if somehow you could stop yourself in time, or from moving in int you would float right? in our normal reference frame."", 'So a fighter pilot feels no inertia when looping the loop or passengers on board a train that suddenly grinds to a halt do not tumble forwards.

They gave me total control over the script and video and didn't ask me to change a thing.\xa0Personally I didn't think this video was too branded because it's about electric cars in general. I drive an electric car and I like it a lot.\n\nI see a lot of the comments concerned that I didn't talk about the negatives of electric cars.

Some people interpret the lack of negatives like I was only allowed to say positive things. That's not true.\n\nObviously in hindsight I should have talked about:\xa0\nElectric cars are still expensive - sure but as I noted battery costs are coming way down and they're cheaper to run\n\nElectric cars produce more CO2 to manufacture than gas cars - but they compensate within 1-5 years by being more efficient and producing less to run\n\nLithium mining isn't great for the environment - true but no mining is great for the environment (it takes a lot to make any car) and we can recycle the batteries a lot more cheaply than going back to mining the raw material. New battery designs are also reducing the amount of rare metals required.\n\nFor long road trips you do need to take pit stops around charging stations.\n\nIf you're thinking about people charging at night, how does that affect the electricity grid? I personally think it's a good thing because it evens out demand, which is usually highest during the day.\n\nHydrogen fuel cell cars - this is just something I personally don't see happening because there's not enough existing infrastructure.

Some solutions are A) remove public parking spaces and turn them into green B) force owners to park inside their building (decrease the status aspect, very succesful in Japan), C) make bicycle lanes outperform car lanes when it comes to door-to-door speed, D) stop putting subsidies in cars, but bring them to bicyles, E) charge for road use per kilogram/km based on car weight."", ""That's a bit sussy actually"", ""Yeah instant torque is cool, but you can never replace the beautiful symphony of a NA V10 (Lexus LFA,Carrera GT) or a 5.0L Supercharged V8 rumbling(Jaguar F-Type SVR) , and the raw mechanical feel of the ICE and the gear changes to feel the change in torque as you shift down from 4 to 3 and the exhaust goes pop pop bang bang , while your massive Turbos goes STUTUTUTUTU or in case of a supercharger , the beautiful whine like a Dodge Demon.

I assume that its orbit is in a place of equilibrium where the gravitational force pulling the dwarf star in matches the centripetal force of the spin pushing it out.  But then a star gets sucked into the black hole.  Wouldn't that massively change the gravity of the black hole?  According to your explanation, such an event would also increase the spin, but are we saying that increase in mass and increase in spin are equivalent somehow?  Or did the dwarf star change its orbital pattern after this event?  I guess we can't compare before & after, but is it in any way possible that it DIDN'T change its orbital pattern after such a dramatic event?  How would a star getting sucked into a black hole change the trajectory of an object already in orbit around that black hole?  Wouldn't it disturb the orbital pattern greatly in the short run, then, settling down, cast the dwarf star into a new long-term orbital pattern?  The bigger implication of what I'm asking is whether the dwarf star was actually there and orbiting in that manner before the event, or if the event introduced the dwarf star into orbit or somehow dramatically changed its orbit.

It's different in that here the fluid starts the ball spinning and there is an equilibrium point around which there are restoring forces. In the Magnus effect the ball must be spinning to begin with and since the fluid is everywhere it can continually change speed and direction.\n2. It's not the Coanda effect. The Coanda effect relies on entraining fluid from the surrounding area creating a region of low pressure. Here there is no water surrounding the stream to entrain (since it is a narrow stream).\n3. Adhesion between the water and the ball is important - this is what directs the water flow over the ball.\n4. The sum of the forces I show should not be zero but equal and opposite to the weight of the ball. Hence the forces of up and out from the initial contact with the stream and up and in from the spray add to make an upward force equal to weight (the in part of the second force is much more important than the up part)\n5.

Criminal investigation is not allowed to call what they do science they have to take advantage of a loophole and call it ""forensic sciences"". Just about the only thing they use that has any backing in science is DNA. Lie detectors are not backed by science, blood splatter pattern is not backed by science, even there fingerprint analysis is not backed by science. Laws and regulation are created by false science or no science and the people appointed to create these laws and regulations are those who need regulated in the first place. For example Dupont has been polluting the world with Teflon for decades on top of decades now. When this was brought to the attention of the powers that be Dupont was taken to court. Dupont was then let off with no charges and no fines because it was determined through scientific study that the levels of Teflon that Dupont had been dumping and the levels of Teflon that would be dangerous for the human body and other living things we\'re not high enough to cause any problems.

And even if an academic establishment like Harvard Yale or Cambridge or any academic establishment for that matter is asked to do the studies the same rules apply because those schools are owned by the same people that own those huge corporations.

Because here there will be additional weight of the ping pong ball(however small it may be)', ""Maybe i'm thinking too much into this, but what about barometric pressures and buoyant force?  When the balance is released, the pressure exerted on the water shifts to find its lowest state of energy.  Since the ping pong ball is suspended in the water, the water in it's vessel cannot move to accommodate any imbalance of pressure.  The Acrylic ball however is not in a fixed position in its vessel, so if there is an imbalance in the pressure the water can shift to accommodate.  Presumably since the ping pong ball has some small amount of mass, and the amount of water in the vessels is equal; the balance would be only slightly weighted towards the ping pong ball side in the absence of the acrylic ball.  When the Acrylic ball is introduced into the the other vessel displacing water it is under a buoyant force with the water and an imbalance of pressure is exerted on the water.  The barometric pressure on the water must be higher than the weight of the water which is being displaced by the Acrylic ball.  At sea level the barometric pressure is almost 15 lbs psi.  Since the amount of water being displaced is about 4 cubic inches it probably only weighs about 0.15 lbs, and the barometric pressure on the water is much greater than that.  So the scale tips towards the Acrylic ball because the barometric pressure put on the water applies a greater buoyant force on the acrylic ball.\n\n\nHope that makes some kind of sense.""]"

In this sense particles can never be intangled in this ""cool"" way.', 'How do we syringe the they undetermined spins without measuring them first?', ""If the opposite particle instantly becomes the inverse of it's twin regardless of distance, does that mean there is a wormhole between them?  Excellent funny and memorable video that is of great use.  Thank you."", 'The video\'s experiment doesn\'t prove anything. It doesn\'t work. The same result is obtained assuming hidden variables or not.\n\nI wrote some code that simulates this experiment. Assuming the particle spins are ""entangled"" (180 degrees from each other), running the probability of passing through the random filters, and counting up how many times they measure ""opposite""... it comes out to 50%. No spooky action needed.\n\nI re-code to INCLUDE spooky action. That is, the first particle\'s angle is randomized, passed through a random filter... and the second particle\'s angle is now dependent upon that. For example, particle 1 having some random angle, passing through a 0-degree filter, and measuring ""spin up"" means particle 2\'s angle is now SET (spoooookily) to 180 degrees (opposite of ""spin up"" for 0-degree filter), passed through a randomly selected filter.... and results compared. ... still 50%\n\nFun fact, you also get the same result with more or less filters available to choose from, AS LONG AS they evenly divide the circle. Sooooo, you could even just choose any random angle to use for the filter (being that all angles evenly divide the circle), and you will get the same result.\n\n\nI think this comes down to the claim in the video at 3:00 - 3:10. If this has been rigorously tested... and the pairs ALWAYS, 100% of the time measure to be opposite when passed through the same angle filter, therein lies the crux. Because, I simulated this as well, and assuming the probability calculation at 1:40 is correct 100% of the time, then the probability of the pairs measuring OPPOSITE when passed through the same-angle filter, is actually 75% of the time, UNLESS spooky action is taking place. So, if that\'s not reflective of reality, then we have spooky action. No fancy filter swapping is even needed.\nCan anyone link me to a study that PROVES this? 100% of the time the pairs will measure opposite, given RANDOM (but entangled) spin angle and passed through the same-angle filter?\n[EDIT]\nThat is, unless the idea of ""probability of passing through the filter"" is also bunk. Assuming that, given ANY slightly-correlated angle to the filter being passed through causes the photon to align, and this probability calculation is just a simple way of saying ""I can\'t see it, but it might be in this orientation"", the whole thing\'s bunk and determinism remains on the table. I mean... according to the probability calculation, even if the photon is 1-degree off, there\'s still a chance the photon will flip a 179 and show up in the opposite orientation.... which....

In the bullet + block we have all three conservation laws always holding, since (approximately) no heat loss, no ext. force, no ext. torque.  So linear *p* has to be roughly conserved (caveats below).   The caveat is I had to assume the bullet gets lodged in the block, this was _not clear_ in your vdo!!! grrr.  Also the difference in sonic + heat loss (and wood splinter loss) energy is roughly the same in both cases, i.e., negligible for the height approximate calculation.

I mean, go ahead, you try to wedge a bullet in an oak or pine wooden block with your hand... it ain\'t so easy without a direct centre hit.\n    So this is an inelastic collision problem, not a GPE <--> RKE trade-off puzzle.\n    How did I do Mum?\n   Also, imagine the bullet hitting a steel block versus a marshmallow or jello block of the same mass... bullet still wedge in... which block will shoot up higher?  The steel block. Far more kinetic deformation damage done to the marshmallow, it\'ll have to be an awfully long marshmallow to keep the bullet still wedged in it, the bullet will make an extremely long core, perhaps a 100m???  Of course, it is harder by hand to dent a steel block, but that\'s a ""lever"" problem.  Pack all the energy you need to core a 100m long marshmallow with a long piece of dowel all at once into a steel block and the steel block will dent a tad, comparatively though a lot less deformation damage. (Actually, I\'d like to see this comparison, my instinct could be wrong, maybe coring a 100m long marshmallow is easy, and ignoring air friction the marshmallow might shoot up higher? You have to account for time (power) though, coring a 100m long marshmallow in a millisecond is awfully hard.)\n      I wonder how many viewers tried it out with neodynium magnetic billiard balls on a slippery surface, or the like. Should see the same result in slower motion.\n\n   In the case of the ""ball rolling down inclined plane"" linear *p* is not conserved because we have friction and normal forces with horizontal un-blanced components, and more un-blanced with a more slippery slope.']"

Here is why:\n\nLets look at Newtons 2nd Law: The sum of all forces (F_tot) on an object is equal to mass * acceleration of that object <=> F_tot=m*a.\xa0\n\nLet's look at this law only in the direction of gravity: You have two opposing forces that act in that direction under realistic conditions: Gravitational force F_g=m*g and Drag Force F_d which depends on the bodies shape, speed and - yes NOT mass!\xa0\nBUT, if we now look at Newton's Second law and rearange it a bit you will see:\na= F_tot/m = g - F_d/m\n\nTherefore if your ball is very heavy, the Drag Force F_d has almost no impact on the acceleration since it is divided by m. Therefore a heavy ball accelerates more than a light ball (e.g. a balloon) towards earth. Both balls however will eventually reach a different terminal velocity, since the Drag Force F_d will increase with the square of the speed and thus oppose the acceleration of the ball more and more.

I feel obliged to clarify. I largely agree with @Armaros and @EebstertheGreat. Just want to elaborate a bit more.\r\nFirst thing first, a = F/m. a is the acceleration in question. m is the mess of jumper. Given he doesn't pee or fart in between, we can assume his mess, m, doesn't change:) We can simply focus on F.\r\nThere are different forces pulling the jumper. \r\n1. Fg - The gravity. Given consistent mess of jumper and the very short distance of movement compared to radius of the Earth, we can assume it doesn't change. Let's use its direction as positive.\r\n2. Fr - The pulling force of bungee rope. Its direction is opposite to gravity. Its magnitude changed along the way. \r\n3. Fa - Air resistance pointed out by @EebstertheGreat . It is small compared with the other two. But we should still take into consideration. It is a bit nasty that its direction is opposite of the moving direction. When jumper is moving down, its direction is opposite to Fg. When he bounced back, its direction is same as Fg.\r\n\r\nNow let's exam the force on jumper for all choices with an important assumption that the weight of rope doesn't count:\r\n\r\na) F = Fg. The rope hasn't begun to pull. Fr is 0. Fa is also 0 because of the 0 speed.\r\n\r\nb) F= Fg - Fr - Fa. Both Fr and Fa are still small. Fg > (Fr + Fa). abs(F) < abs(Fg)\r\n\r\nc) F= 0. Since jumper reached max speed at c. That means Fr + Fa just matched Fg and began to overtake. Fa reached its maximum value at this point. Fr will keep growing when the rope is stretched further.\r\n\r\nd) F = Fg - Fr. Fa is 0 due to 0 speed.\r\n\r\ne) The video simply said e is 'on the rebound'. This is not clear. Rebound is a long process from the d to the point he reached maximum height, which let's call it f) to simplify the discussion. Before jumper reached f)\r\n\r\nF = Fg - Fr + Fa. Fr reduced to 0 in the process. That is where you saw the rope looks like a shape of J.\r\n\r\nf) F = Fg.\r\n\r\nOverall Fa is way smaller than Fg and Fr. We can ignore until we compare two number only differed by Fa.\r\nAlso, the acceleration could be either direct just like F itself. We have to compare abs(F)\r\n\r\nNow let's pick the answer.\r\na) ties with f)\r\nc) won't be the answer obviously.\r\ne) won't be the answer because Fr in e) smaller than Fr in d) When Fa is noticeable, Fr is already way smaller.\r\n\r\nNow let's focus on d). If abs(Fr) > 2 * abs(Fg), then it is the answer. As many already pointed out. There is no guarantee. From the video, the upward acceleration from bottom up didn't seem to be greater than the downward acceleration when he started either. But I am not 100% sure.\r\n\r\nIf the rope is an inelastic steel cable, jumper will bounce back as fast as basketball bounced back from ground. In that case, I bet d) will be the answer.

So I could design some fine tuned stress-strain relationship matched to the weight and hight of the jump where the acceleration at the lowest point is below g. Most rubbers have a intermediate strain area where the stress remains constant which is definetly what you want from a bungee cord. Then the acceleration at the lowest point could be below g. But the argument that the deceleration time is longer than the acceleration time still stands.', 'Double cliff hanger!', ""I like this problem. I'm a physics instructor but had to think about this for a bit before I answered. I got this correct but at first went back and forth between option A and D. I had to write a net force equation to solve it. For option A: Fnet = ma = mg so the acceleration is 9.81 m/s/s downward. For option D, Fnet = ma = T - mg. However T is the tension in the rope which is equal to kx. So how do we find k? We use conservation of energy. We start with gravitational potential energy mgH and end with elastic potential energy 1/2kx^2. Set these two equal to each other at the lowest point. mgH = 1/2kx^2. Solve for k and we get k=(2mgH)/(x^2). Now let's substitute kx into our Fnet equation. Fnet = ma = kx - mg OR another way to write this is Fnet = ma = 2mgHx/(x^2) - mg. Simplify to get Fnet = ma = 2mgH/x - mg. Since H is larger than x because the total height is larger than the distance the rope stretches we get Fnet = ma = 2mg*(some number larger than 1) - mg which always results in a net acceleration value greater than 9.81 m/s/s. So it doesn't depend on k or m because in order for the bungee jumper to not hit the ground, H must be larger than x."", 'Can anyone prove to me that jumpers speed increases each second by more than 9.8 m/s when he gets to the lowest point?', 'There is however one constraint to k, H and m:\xa0\xa0\xa0 kH > mg\nThis is always true, since the rope is able to stop the jumper before he hits the ground.', ""The answer depends not only on the elasticity of the rope, but also on the height from which he jumps and his mass. Let me explain:\nInitially, potential energy is mgH, and there is no kinetic energy. At the bottom, potential energy is 1/2 kx^2 (we can neglect the height at the bottom).\nSo, mgH = 1/2 kx^2. From here we get x = sqrt (2mgH / k).\nThe elastic force at the bottom is: kx, which is equal to sqrt (2kmgH).\nThis needs to be greater than 2mg, for the acceleration to be higher at the bottom than at the top.\nLet's see:\nsqrt (2kmgH) >? 2mg\nIf we square this. we get:\n2kmgH >? 4m^2g^2\nkH/2m > g\nSo, this is the condition for the acceleration to be greatest at the bottom. It shows clearly that it depends on k, H and m, which can all vary independently. For example, which is very intuitive, if the height is not big enough, then the acceleration at the bottom can be very weak."", ""Curses! \xa0I'm a physicist and I got this wrong... \xa0My initial intuition was that the correct answer relies on the elastic properties of the bungee but this is not the case. \xa0You can use conservation of energy to get the spring constant k of the bungee: mgH = 1/2 kh^2, where H is the height of the platform and h is the amount the bungee is stretched from when it first becomes taught to its lowest point. \xa0Then you balance the forces at the bottom, kh - mg = ma, and sub in the previous value for k. \xa0Cancelling common factors you find a = g(2H/h - 1). \xa0Since h<H, it must always be that a>g, so acceleration at the bottom is always greatest. \xa0"", ""So does this mean that the acceleration due the bungee at its most stretched point, D, is *greater* than 9.8+9.8, 19.6?

For one, that would be more related to electromagnetic force due to like or different charges causing them to attract. Such Formula for this is very very similar to Newtons Law of Graviation. In the most strictest sense however, gravity is the effect that a body of mass has on the universe, IE spacetime. The gravitational constant is the universal constant that a body of mass has on the universe, or rather how much it stretches it. For example if you have a blanket with a grid lined pattern all around it, with all of it being equal distance. Introducing a mass or a pull on the blanket will cause the distance between the fibers to stretch which is why in black holes, the mass of it causes time to slow and space to expand. Similarly, if you do this with a blanket, such similar effect will happen visually. There is always a force acting on the universe if a body has mass which is called gravity.

The moon doesn\'t orbit the earth.  The moon and the earth orbit a common point that represents the centre of gravity or mass of the earth-moon system.  Those two points might not be the same, but we can consider them to be so for the purposes of this discussion.  A fairly rough calculation using the formula for the centre of mass between the two bodies places it about just over a third of the earth\'s diameter from the earth\'s centre.  This is very deep under the earth.  It is also very important not just for the earth-moon orbital relationship, but also for life on earth, because a lot of potential energy is generated by the centre of mass/gravity which transmits as heat energy inside and through the earth, helping to heat up the planet.  If the moon disappeared suddenly, that heat would dissipate and the earth would quickly cool significantly to either extend the polar ice caps or lead to an ice age.  When sped up to high speed, you would see that while the moon appears to orbit the earth, the earth also ""wobbles"" around the centre of gravity.  The moon\'s gravitational influence also contributes to earthquakes and earthquake prediction centres measure the moon\'s distance and position very closely for that reason and they predict tectonic movement with astonishing accuracy.  The same thing happens to the Sun in relation to each of the planets in the Solar System.  An object, no matter how tiny, has an effect on another object (no matter how massive that object is) within its sphere of influence.  If you throw a ball in the air, the Newton\'s First Principle of Motion reaction force causes the earth and ball to move apart ever so fractionally until the ball reaches its high-point, and then as it falls back to earth the effect of gravity between the earth and the ball cause them to attract each other and they meet at their original start positions.', ""After General theory of Relativity, how do you explain the Moon's pull on earth?

And these appear to be students that are of some level of achieving basic college courses.\nThere was a similar survey shown in front of Princeton University a couple decades ago and it was just as bad, as they thought it had something to do with the distance of the Earth to the Sun, which they vaguely misunderstood is varying between summer and Winter, [but the distance of the Earth is closer to the Sun in December and further in July which is the opposite of our warmer and cooler seasons in the Northern Hemisphere]. \nI saw diagrams in my first little astronomy book when I was about 5 or 6 years of age and I understood it right from there on and ever since, when I saw the diagram showing the Earth tilted at 23 and a half degrees relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. It shows the Earth on one side, say it Winter time with the Northern Hemisphere tilted away from the Sun and the less direct rays on the Winter Solstice date, eventually causing the colder winter weather. The diagram continues and shows the Earth on the opposite side during the first day of Summer at the June Solstice, showing the sun's rays more direct to create the warmer Summer weather. In between of course are the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes, I the in milder in-between weather conditions. It's really that simple, but when you ask students to describe it they are suddenly confused.\nThis is but one small aspect of why most people still today in the modern world flunk basic science exams. It was demonstrated in the last interview that Charlie Rose conducted with Carl Sagan. You can look this up and watch it, from May 1996, as Rose reads the beginning of the introduction of Carl Sagan, from a New York Times article, titled -  Americans Flunk Science - Over Half of American Adults Are not aware that the Earth orbits the Sun once a year.\nWhat's further mistaken in the misperception by many is that this 23 and a half degree tilt wobbles back and forth as the Earth rotates around the Sun, say, from Summer on one side of the Sun, to Winter, halfway around to the other side of the Sun.\nIt doesn't wobble at all, [except over perhaps 50,000 years as to what is known as precession a very slow movement like a top spinning that slows down and begins to waver back and forth on its axis, that the axis of the earth will soon one day point to Vega as the North Star,] so the yearly axis pointing toward Polaris remains perfectly relative to that tilt 365 and 1/4 days a year. \nIt's the fact of the relative point along the Earth's orbit as to what varies the tilt from one side of the Sun to the other. \nThe risk of a long explanation here but to simplify it, just hold your hand up at an angle and draw a circle out in front of you from side to side, keeping the angle the same as you move it - this is what the Earth is doing, and you can also draw smaller circles with your hand while it's at the 23 1/2 degree angle, and this will represent to understand the relative distance of the sun's rays being much less upon us in the northern hemisphere at the extreme of the first day of Winter, the Winter Solstice, on approximately December 21st every year.\nThen move your hand to the other side of the imaginary circle you motion around the Sun, [in the middle] keeping the tilt of your hand at the same angle and realize when the earth comes around to daytime facing the Sun those rays are much shorter and direct at the summer solstice on approximately June 21st.\nIt's very basic and simple physics but common intuition tells the average person otherwise thus they develop their common misperceptions.\n\n*It took me awhile to get to the end of the video because while I was writing, I was voice texting, and this stops the video when you voice text.

Britain’s situation was so dire, the government sent the economist John Maynard Keynes with a delegation to the US to beg for financial assistance, claiming that Britain was facing a ""financial Dunkirk”. The Americans were willing to do so, on one condition: They would supply Britain with the financing, goods and materials to rebuild itself, but dictated that Britain must first eliminate those Sterling Balances by repudiating all its debts to its colonies. The alternative was to receive neither assistance nor credit from the US. *Britain, impoverished and in debt, with no natural resources and no credit or ability to pay, had little choice but to capitulate. And of course with all receivables cancelled and since the US could produce today, those colonial nations had no further reason for refusing manufactured goods from the US. The strategy was successful. By the time Britain rebuilt itself, the US had more or less captured all of Britain’s former colonial markets, and for some time after the war’s end the US was manufacturing more than 50% of everything produced in the world.

If you didn\'t die you should have been close to it but hacked yourself to a win using mad rage preferably. ^^ \n A person typically didn\'t go on a single such trip, and those who did often went one time.

Lust for personal glory and riches lost you points rather than the other way around - as a christian. \n At 1066 It would already have been close to impossible to create a ""Viking"" army as christianity by then was pretty widespread on all levels of social leadership, as Strong kings and nationlike entities was or was just about to be, created. All with christian rulers who demanded the same from the regional kings or Jarls. (Regional kings in old scandinavian lingos). Later the nobility.\n  But 1066, a major event in what is now England stirred up a lot of emotions up here. And a last time even a lot of christians signed up for a last trip to settle the score that had to be reacted to. If not for that, by 1066 the tradition was already on it\'s way out. It still would\'ve gone on here and there for a while though, mainly in form of pure trading trips - and that did happen.\n\n No more could you fix a bad social reputation or fix a bad standing with the divine by the act of (far away) robbery and murder for no reason. Or with the use of suicidal risk taking for it\'s own sake. Many went to other nations and fought as mercenaries instead to gain status for instance. And if the sold themselves to good or bad causes was not the important part. More so that they were so ready to measure themselves in combat that they did it EVEN when not needing. The gods in norse religion do that for fun all the time. And those ppl who made it to Valhalla. Fight to the death is like Gaming, or soft ball to them. But then they resurrected and had dinner kind of. So it was an easy conclusuion to do, life and death combat in itself was a way to impress gods with. \n\n Those Gods did not bless anything meek.\nMeek was just something you slowed down to kill and rob, on your way to adventure, trading with those who at least tried to defend themselves and could be respected as human or to invade something or searching REAL combat. \n\n The difference between religions and the organisation of power and life they led to (as well as much fewer soft targets in Europe) killed the tradition. \nFrom European view that tradition, or socially organized opportunity, seemed like a people of warriors that periodically showed up. \n But these guys were usually farmers all their lives EXCEPT a couple of months once or a few times in a life time, Most never went. Farmers that happened to have a religion that greatly rewarded them in the eyes of their gods for doing it. \n A couple went together from one village one from another. In some towns many, and some towns rarely anyone. Just like with all traditioins, they are stronger here and there. And the sence of being immortal and to seek adventure is strong during young years in many. With a free way to sign up for such a thing, in a society that is organised with that in mind - and with the chance to become rich and respected - it\'s not strange they had tons of young men to man the boats with. \n Under christianity you had to pay yourself. organise yourself, you\'d be seen to run away from responsibility at home. You\'d be looked down on for most activities done on such a trip and you\'s soul came further from heaven. Work for the UN in a starving country in Africa might be a similar analogue as what they did though. Something that you can feel good about. Get respect for. That (if religious) your god will like, if not Norse. ^^\n\nYou don\'t call them UNites for life after though. ;) And even if they would\'ve been seen from Subsahara to be a population of pale beings from up north somewhere if it was back in the day - they would not constitute population or a defined part of one. Like warriors, or a guild, be from a certain part of a nation, or social standing. \n They just represent a ""cultural"", moral and adventurous choice that our religious and moral code gives strong incentives for. To such a degree that you basically just need to sign up.\nSo actually a good thing to compare with.\n\n Other reasons affected the end of the Viking going tradition as well of course. But even with ONLY the change in religion it would\'ve happened at the same time anyway, plus minus very little.\n\n Any other reason is a detail.', 'Only Indian Culture managed to save itself from both, the Islamic and Christian Invasion and occupation.', 'Please stop those sword noises it’s driving me mad.

And though they did engange in raids, they did so to rebel against the existing rules of Brittain, France, Spain, Holland, or what ever nation they hail from. Granted - Many pirates were drawn to the lifestyle, due to the promiss of wealth, they didn\'t start out that way. - Vikings went on Raids to bring wealth home to their own homes, countries or towns.

While ‘‘the name ‘Tatar’ was ‘the name of the own ethnos (nation) of Chinghiz Khan'. Also ‘…Chinghiz Khan and his people did not speak the language, which we now call the ‘Mongolian’…’’ (an academician-orientalist V.P.Vasiliev, 19th century). This confirmed by many little known data. So in fact Chinghiz Khan was from among the medieval Tatars and the outstanding and progressive leader of the Turkic peoples. \r\nAbout the real faith of Chinghiz Khan and his native people: for example, the Turkish traveler Celebi (17th century) wrote the following from the words of Tatar alims (scientists): ‘It is proved that Chinghiz Khan was a Muslim, and the Tatars professed Islam already during the life of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon Him)’. \r\nAlso, as Tatar alims told Chelebi, Chingiz Khan had been buried in the Volga region, not far from the city of Astrakhan. Moreover, there is a lot of data about this, hidden from us.                  \r\n\r\nIt is worth saying that according to many little-known data, the ancient and medieval Tatars were a very developed people both in spiritual and material aspects. It was the medieval Tatars who created the first Constitution of Eurasia, which was called in Tatar ‘Great Yasu’ (‘Yasu’ in Tatar means 'Scripture').\r\nBut with time many of their descendants became spiritually disabled and forgot invaluable doctrine and covenants of the creators of Great Yasu... \r\nSo that the Tatars of Chinghiz Khan - medieval Tatars - were one of the Turkic nations, whose descendants now live in many of the fraternal Turkic peoples of Eurasia - among Tatars, Kazakhs, Bashkirs, Uighurs, and many others. \r\nAnd few people know that the ethnos of medieval Tatars, which stopped the expansion of the Persians and the Chinese to the West of the World in Medieval centuries, is still alive. Despite to the politicians of the tsars Romanovs tsars and Bolsheviks dictators, which had divided and scattered this ethnos to different nations...\n\n\r\nAbout everything above mentioned and a lot of the true history of the Tatars and other fraternal Turkic peoples, that  was hidden from us, had been written, in detail and proved, in the book  ‘Forgotten Heritage of Tatars’ - it is one of books by  an independent historian Gali Yenikey, translated in Engilsh. \r\nThere are a lot of previously little-known historical facts, as well as 16 maps and illustrations in this book. This e-book (in English language) you can easily find in the Internet here:  https://www.kobo.com/ebook/forgotten-heritage-of-tatars-1  or here: https://payhip.com/b/Xujb         \r\n \r\nOn the cover of this book you can see the true appearance of Chinghiz Khan. It is his lifetime portrait.   In the ancient Tatar historical source ‘About the clan of Chinghiz Khan’ its author gave the words of the mother of Chinghiz Khan: ‘My son Chinghiz looks like this: he has a golden bushy beard, he wears a white fur coat and rides on a white horse’. As we can see, the portrait of an unknown medieval artist in many ways corresponds to the words of the mother of the Hero, which have come down to us in this ancient Tatar epic. Therefore, this portrait, which corresponds to the information of the Tatar source and to data from other sources, we believe, the most reliably transmits the appearance of Chinghiz Khan...’.\n\n\r\nAnd here's another interesting thing:\r\nWe can't keep silent that some 'very important' official historians try to retell the content (or rather, the concept) of the works of the independent historian Gali Yenikey (Yenikeiev).  But they conceal where the information was by them taken from. However it turned out they were unsuccessful and confused – this official historians, apparently, do not dare to show the real history of the Tatars, being afraid of their ‘scientific chiefs’.\r\nBut not only this – see the portrait of Chingiz Khan - see on the 7th minute of the video of the Institute of history of the Academy of Sciences of Tatarstan (Russia): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WqB71gs5bc&t=2s     - also this portrait is shown there both before and after.\r\nThis portrait is reconstruction, which made by Yenikeiev on the basis of a lifetime portrait of Chingiz Khan   and of information from the medieval Tatar Dastan (epic) 'About the Origin of Ciingiz Khan', as well as from other historical sources. \r\nThis portrait was used by authors of the video without Yenikeiev's permission and without telling where the portrait came from. This portrait is published on the cover of G. R.  Yenikeiev's book ‘Forgotten heritage of the Tatars’: see: https://payhip.com/b/Xujb   \r\nFor the first time this portrait was published on the cover of the third book by G. R. Yenikeiev ‘In the footsteps of the black legend’ (published in 2009), see its electronic version: https://payhip.com/b/DNdC   \r\nThis ‘creativity’ of the official historians is called among the decent people as plagiarism - that is, as theft."", ""The bubonic plague they were the main carriers bringing it along the silk road that's why it came through in waves"", 'I$lam destroy everything']"

Instead, the language that is not inspired by these purposes continues its course, so that a gap is created between the official norm and the so-called vulgar Latin. The distance between the two traditions tends to grow over time and the early medieval world will receive the two strands by now quite distinct in terms of structures: the language of conversation by family tradition and literary and legal Latin for cultural heritage. While in the second century. B.C. many evolutionary events still occur, in the first century. B.C. literary Latin remains almost immobile (not so the spoken Latin).

There, in 1524, as he was looking at the west, Esteban Gomez, who had persuaded the Emperor Charles to let him go and to make fund an expedition to search for a northwest passage, wrote indicating that there was no sea passage south of the bay of the entrance of St Lawrence river: “Acá\xa0nada”, the Spanish words for ""Here, nothing"", unaware that he had just baptized the vastness of Canada. Spaniards also explored the Gulf of Mexico and the coast from California to Alaska, planted thousands of place names after the saints in the calendar they had in hand, compiled maps and charts,\xa0described\xa0lands, new animals and tribes. They brought with them the\xa0horse, that\xa0was introduced in Florida by Pedro Menendez de Aviles and in New Mexico by Juan de\xa0Oñate. The explorers who came after the sixteenth century took their first steps following targeted maps and daily courses first made by the Spanish explorers.\nPedro Menendez de Aviles opened in Florida the gateway to North America. Spaniards founded San\xa0Agustín, the first European city in what the United States of America is at present. There they celebrated the first Mass of Thanksgiving accompanied by natives. They erected the first council house, school, church, convent and mission, the first books were printed by them. They built the first fort, which they named San Marcos.\nArriving on the southwest, Juan de\xa0Oñate\xa0introduced the horse, the ditch, the wheel, the Spanish agriculture, which merged with the local creating a valuable exchange that never ceased to enrich the Old and the New World. There the first play was written and represented; there the first American epic was composed by Gaspar de Villabrá, first European lawyer in North America. There the first European was born in 1566, Martín de Argüelles Jr, son of a Spanish sergeant and Leonor Morales. The first English settlers appeared half a century later.\nIn the late eighteenth century, part of the present territory of the United States was inhabited by descendants of English settlers who came into conflict with the mother and took up arms to achieve independence. The Spaniards in Florida, Cuba, Mexico and Puerto Rico responded to the call of Charles III to free the Americans fighting for independence led by Washington. Spanish, both New Spaniards and Cubans, had business houses in the thirteen American colonies. They ran business, and their currency, the Spanish silver dollar, that dollar with the two pillars on it, was the first coin to inspire the U.S. dollar. Two Spaniards, Juan de\xa0Miralles\xa0and\xa0Erigio\xa0de la Puente recruited a network of secret agents by which troops Washington could know the British movements using Louisiana as a free-of-enemies corridor parallel to the thirteen colonies, made available by the Spaniards and Bernardo de Galvez, who knew the needs and intentions of the Continental Army and transmitted to Spain, from where weapons, equipment and, especially, millions of hard silver\xa0pesos\xa0(Spanish valuable coins) were sent to Washington.\nCharles III went to war against England on June 16, 1779, ready to economically and militarily\xa0help\xa0Americans of the thirteen colonies. Before, from the declaration of war of Spain, he had been helping Americans through Bernardo de\xa0Gálvez. In 1777, Benjamin Franklin, American representative in France, called for secret aid from Spain obtaining by this mean 215 bronze cannons, tents, grenades, 30,000 muskets, bayonets and uniforms, musket balls and 300,000 pounds of powder. Franklin, thankful for it, wrote a letter to the Count of\xa0Aranda\xa0appreciating all the help, and subsequently received over 12,000 muskets, sent to Boston from Spain. In addition, Spain gave almost 2,000,000 silver\xa0pesos.\nThe ships of the American Commodore Alexander\xa0Gillon\xa0were repaired and provided with artillery in the Royal Shipyard of Havana; the governor of Louisiana, Bernardo de Galvez and his brother Joseph were aware of all movements. Galvez\'s plan was clear: to shield the Mississippi Delta so that the British could not move around the river to bring reinforcements to its troops locked in the entrenched camp of Georgetown, to take the control of the Caribbean Sea taking the bases of the British navy, to conquer Pensacola and the rest of the fortified ports the English had in the Mississippi Delta and inland to the north, along the river, and strengthen Washington\'s Continental Army for easy victory. In a series of remedial actions defeated the British at\xa0Manchac, Natchez, ports Thompson and Smith, Baton Rouge, Fort Charlotte and\xa0Mobilla, took their military bases and fully evicted them while ensuring alliance pacts with the local Indian tribes hostile to the British.\nAfter the Mississippi Delta and their forts were taken, the English in Georgetown could neither receive reinforcements nor attack Washington from the rear. Then Galvez would take Pensacola, fortified British garrison. He met the forces in Havana. After a first step, he quickly enlisted a second expedition. So he embarked the Spanish regular forces together with the Resident Battalion of Havana, the Battalion of Black and Brown Men, and auxiliaries. Pensacola was taken in two months, from April to May 1781; the British had five hundred casualties, about two hundred Spaniards. British General John Campbell and Admiral Chester, Captain General and Governor of West Florida respectively, surrendered along with their 1,113 men and all their flags, artillery, ammunition, along with over three hundred Americans from Georgia who supported the British forces, five British warships being taken too. Pensacola marked the Spanish control of the Gulf of Mexico and deprived the English of its most powerful base to launch attacks on preventing Washington from the south.\nIn mid-1781, on the eve of the battle of Yorktown fought from September to October, Washington and his army were in deplorable conditions, with its empty coffers. The farmers refused to provide food for nonpayment, and weapons and gunpowder were needed too. After failing in his efforts to raise money in French Santo Domingo, De Grasse went to Cuba, where authorities and the women sold their jewelry, donating one million two hundred thousand silver pounds.\nAfter Yorktown, which was not actually the last battle, the only base remaining real British was Nassau in the Bahamas, so a Spanish force from Havana commanded by\xa0Cajigal\xa0entered the archipelago and they took Nassau on May 11, 1782, finally\xa0falling\xa0this last English stronghold. However, the English launched Rodney’s squad against Havana, but\xa0Cajigal’s\xa0defense thwarted all the attempts of landing.\nOn September 3, 1783, the War of Independence ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.\nEvery July 4 names that carried out the heroic freedom struggle are remembered: Franklin, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Jay, Madison, Paine, Hamilton -- also reminding those of La Fayette, Rochambeau, Truffaut, De Grasse, the Polish Kościuszko and the Prussian General Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben.\nHowever, no mention or squints to Bernardo de Galvez, his brother Minister José de Gálvez, Juan María Manuel de Cajigal and Francisco Saavedra, financial support of American independence; Juan Miralles, a personal friend of Washington; all those who, along with Juan Eligio de la Puente, developed or gave secret information and decisive actions to victory. To these must be added those who fell in the Mississippi Delta in Pensacola or in the Bahamas; and from there going back to the intrepid explorers, missionaries who brought the Word of God, who planted the first crosses and founded cities and towns, who brought books, laws, concepts and thoughts, humanism and philosophy. All these people were also Founding Fathers, and they deserve to be remembered in the day of the Declaration of Independence too. And along with them, all those ones who with their bodies and their souls participated in forging the greatness of the United States of America, the land of free men, so they were not notably absent in the glorious date of July 4\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BvvmHjxnLic', 'But the Americans were British haha celebrating a British civil war is very cringe', ""That's because the bigest battle of the war was fought in Spain...""]"

By the\r\ntime the blockade had started, in about 1949, the Soviet Union had already been\r\nfeeding the local population of Berlin for nearly four years. Like America, the\r\nSoviet Union was the bread basket & food basket of Europe. They could\r\neasily feed 5 million POW\'s (POW = prisoner of war). Germany had surrendered in\r\nmay 1945. Even Germans were dancing ballroom dances with Soviet officers in\r\ntown halls and on the streets and in town in many towns except Berlin. It\r\nbecomes the duty of the ruling party or ideology or country to feed the local\r\npopulation: There were atleast a couple of incidents which made the key\r\ndecision makers to never re- start a war or think in those lines: Some\r\nhistorical documentary of the Berlin blockade in black& white that I had\r\nseen in the Boston area in about 1987 either in the history channel or National\r\ngeographic or a similar channel in the late 1980\'s clarified that : 1) The\r\nSoviets were Distributing a Soviet new food stamps in order to alleviate hidden\r\nhunger to quickly distribute food among the the hungry residents of Berlin. The\r\nRussian leadership claimed that with this new food stamp program they introduce\r\nwill win the hearts and minds of the Germans in Berlin. Western officials\r\nallowed in requested the Berliners to turn down the food stamps even if they go\r\nhungry, as Berliners may be possibly be brainwashed into thinking that\r\ncommunism is a good concept. 2) The soviets had introduced a new currency in\r\nEast Germany including Berlin, so that local Berliners and East Germans get\r\npaid every time they do work for eight hours or four hours or whatever\r\naccordingly. Western officials living in the Soviet Zone were allowed into\r\nBerlin and East Germany, but they asked East Germans and Berliners to revolt\r\nand to burn those currencies., until the Soviets asked them to leave. Moscow asked\r\nthe westerners to leave Berlin around 1948 or 1949 because of the above two\r\nreasons among other reasons. This explanation pacified the American officials\r\nand more importantly, the American president. When these westerners who were\r\nliving in the Soviet Zone of Berlin finally left, these same western officials\r\nwere the first to defend Moscow, saying they the food stamps program for hungry\r\nBerliners and the new Eat German Deutchmark currency program weren\'t\r\nnecessarily bad for locals of Berlin, as Berliners will get aid if they work in\r\na bakery or in the new East German police force and the like. War was never\r\nimminent. in post ww2 Berlin. Communists believe in taxing 70 percent of the\r\nnew yearly income of billionaires, and they believe in distributing the money\r\ntaxed from the rich among the lowest 10 percent of the population. How did\r\ntheir food stamps work? suppose a Soviet soldier calls to say that there are 10\r\nhungry children in the neighborhood of his place of duty in Reuterkiez, the\r\nsoldier calls his officer, ""Sir i need 10 food stamps for 10 hungry German\r\nchildren at my place of duty. I just gave away my lunch to one of the children.\r\n"" The soviet soldier may say, ""This is Private Stan Pushkin.

It became the standard map projection for navigation because it is unique in representing north as up and south as down everywhere while preserving local directions and shapes. The map is thereby conformal. As a side effect, the Mercator projection inflates the size of objects away from the equator. This inflation is very small near the equator but accelerates with increasing latitude to become infinite at the poles. As a result, landmasses such as Greenland and Antarctica appear far larger than they actually are relative to landmasses near the equator, such as Central Africa.\n\nBecause of great land area distortions, some consider the projection unsuitable for general world maps. Therefore, Mercator himself used the equal-area sinusoidal projection to show relative areas. However, despite such distortions, the Mercator projection was, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, perhaps the most common projection used in world maps, despite being much criticized for this use.\n\nBecause of its very common usage, the Mercator projection has been supposed to have influenced people's view of the world, and because it shows countries near the Equator as too small when compared to those of Europe and North America, it has been supposed to cause people to consider those countries as less important. As a result of these criticisms, modern atlases no longer use the Mercator projection for world maps or for areas distant from the equator, preferring other cylindrical projections, or forms of equal-area projection. The Mercator projection is still commonly used for areas near the equator, however, where distortion is minimal.

It is a historical marine accident that carries great signs for humanity and needs lessons to be learned. Let\'s look at it from another perspective. Let\'s update what has not been deliberately said and what we do not know.\r\nBoundaries were drawn according to the classification of people, wealth, clothing, color, language, religion, and race. Proud bodies that no one can tolerate each other, that even give them an upper hand. Even by their arrogance, those who did not come side by side could not digest the fact that even those classified, left to the lower floors of the ship, travel on this ship. The thoughts that we should be the only ones on this ship sat in their hearts full of arrogance. These are the known. We would tell you for hours what you\'ve never heard of, believe me, you couldn\'t sleep from having nightmares.\r\nTITANIC, just like the World. Even the ship could not tolerate this inhuman savagery that traveled on them. It\'s time to stop now. Those who said that even God cannot sink this ship, the night of April 15, 1912, and those who challenged him, were assigned to an iceberg coming from the poles. He fulfilled the order given to him. All of a sudden, the balances were equalized. People were on the same boat regardless of who they were. Everyone rushed here and there to survive. Those who tried to give morale to the society with the music feast playing on the deck suddenly disappeared in the dark. There was a terrible fear of death. The day of the test had come. While the existing rescue boats could take 80 people, those who were still pursuing authority and superiority escaped with 5 to 10 people. Those who tried to get on the lifeboats crushed their heads with shovels. Those who talked about civilization and human rights had tarred eyes and stone hearts. Their dark mouth opened with pride given to them by the expensive appetizers they ate and drank a few hours ago. Those carrying proud bodies, whose eyes were not full, could not bear to see someone else even in the boats they boarded. Whereas, if the society had to do, the rules of being human, were obeyed, if everyone could roam freely on this ship, all would survive.\r\nLet\'s take a look at the other ship. It was said to stop for a while to the violence and massacres in the world. Those who did not let anyone into their own countries took the land of others from under their feet. Those who do not give anyone tolerance to life made the world uninhabitable. What are those who have watched and approved of what they did now?\r\nAnother task was assigned to a new King and his army. Although they cover their hearts, ears, eyes, mouths and borders, this army is fully equipped and equipped as far as I know. He even escaped the kings from their mansions and sat on their thrones. He travels every country without any borders. His and his soldiers galloping in their horseshoes resemble crunching on ice. What dreadful preparation. It is not thought-provoking that those who watch someone\'s screams are still watching when the time comes and they are watched. So the silent cries of those who moan under the persecution of the tyrants were heard. Those who ignored those who were persecuted, and those who remained silent, silently fell upon them, even though they could never see them.\r\nLast word, who awakened this sleeping giant? “When this missionary army, which has taken orders from a certain place, takes the whole world under its influence, those who do not care about him fall into a great surprise and anxiety. Perhaps the steel bodies that rained fear and cruelty to the world with their planes on their shoulders were swallowed by the seas, the fear and shiver that fell on them like a nightmare leave them in a long silence again. Then it is an opportunity for the Earth to breathe a little and for certain communities to recover. ""\r\nYes, we awakened a big beast like a glacial mountain.\r\nFirst of all, know that every new day will not be better than the previous one. The world opened its door to a new King and his army sent upon him. This king and his army will be written in gold letters in the history of the world. We are now at the crossroads where an age closes and a new age opens. The dates will talk about these painful years as follows. It is like the years and after when the cold ice viruses broke off from the poles and decorated like ice crystals. What a fearful moment it is to have a world that closes in, like a pimple that explodes and proliferates insanely with different disguises and names from different regions when it is touched upon. Human history will never forget this. Because in a century when technology and possibilities were so powerful, we see that 21st century humanity is on its knees in the face of the unseen silent army that suddenly appears. 525648000….

Ask yourself:  How much tissue is scraped away during pap?  If you have only a single epithelial layer of cells to defend your cervix...and that\'s scraped away...then what\'s left?\nAnd when HPV is given ""cuts"" to go deeper into your cervix thanks to pap and an aggressive clinician, then here you go...CIN.\nNow again.  Look at the diagram.  If what is said here is true (before I was told CIN was how much of cervix surface was involved...hmmm the change)...  \nAnyhoo... IF docs scrape away all that tissue?  What is left?  Is this why it hurts?  Why we bleed?\nAnd also now you know why they cause such a painful mess of your cervix and especially your endocervical canal during colposcopy.  Why it hurts so much more.  Why they deny and lie so much more too.  \nAll preventable.  \nWhat Dr Nicholas does for HPV issues is to introduce a chemical that causes mild surface destruction.  You feel a sting as you do when the vinegar solution is applied during pap/colposcopy.  This kills all the cells on the surface.  He uses an herbal concentration plus a concentration of natural anticancer chemicals found in foods.  He has success w/o all the destruction.\nYou don\'t have to slash & burn.  That\'s the point.\nPAP CANNOT DIAGNOSE ADENOCARCINOMA.  IT CAN\'T IT CAN\'T IT CAN\'T.\nBECAUSE A GLANDULAR CANCER WHICH ADENOCARCINOMA CC IS GROWS FROM VERY DEEP TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE.\nBY THE TIME IT REACHES THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR CERVIX IT\'S SPREAD (METASTASIZED) ALL OVER YOUR UTERUS ETC.\nTHE COMPUTER WHICH READS THE SLIDES IS NOT--NO IT\'S NOT--PROGRAMMED TO ""READ"" THIS TYPE OF CANCER.\nPeriod.  So now and then a real live farting pathologist will ""oversample"" or re-read the slides.  Sometimes disease is found this way--but rarely so.\n\nAnd again, adenocarcinomas are NOT diagnosed this way.  That\'s why it\'s (this type) has usually spread so much by diagnosis.  You must watch your body for other, early symptoms.  And watch your past immediate relatives plus environmental exposures. \n\nJust like I knew.  Nothing relating what is wrong with pap is discussed.  Notice how after adenocarcinomas the video stops?!\n\nGotta get in that last fear mongering tactic...just in case the rest of the BS failed to impress you into submitting to the BS.\n\nFollow the ""instructional"" video>>>you\'re scared to death and on the phone come 8am next day for your pelvic.\n\nKnow the facts, do not be fazed by the BS here.', ""AT 4 minutes.  They say the pap is not a histological test but cytological.  And then they say it's histological after all.  They say the tests are so important to measure cellular division.  What they don't say is that it takes up to 10 yrs for these cells to become invasive.  That every woman is exposed to HPV and most fight it off over a 2 year period of time.\nNever are men tested.  If you're infected, why isn't HE tested too?  What about your mouths?  And reinfection?  \nOf course no answers given.\nSo then too, look at how the instruments are stored.  Since this video is to tech to convince of morons of it's life saving importance (hey tune in here we know what's best for you---and we use big words to hypnotize you into saying YES to all the small procedures we want to do---like cut, fry, etc with pain which is never mentioned here because you should be happy to have lots of pain because you COULD DIE TOMORROW FROM HPV YOU DUMB BITCH SO BE HAPPY I'M HERE TO FEEL YOU UP AND DO WHAT I TELL YOU I WANT TO DO TO YOU!!.  Oh have a wonderful day too.  \nHow many times have you seen the instruments just sitting out in the open?  Non-sterile.  Right there for anybody to play with?  How about the table?  What was oozing where your ass is right now?  The toilet seat where they told you to urinate?  \nIf anybody has HPV and does not abide by near total sterile bathroom habits, then simply to going there, turning the handle, opening the door or touching the pen, or allowing them to use those non-sterile instruments on you---\nYou're opening yourself to infection.  That simple.\nA gyn office should be wiped clean with 90% alcohol each time a patient comes (I mean arrives) and goes.  \nWould you use a wooden spatula to clean an infected wound?  NO\nThen why is this ok to use on your cervix?\nPap is 53% accurate.  The alternatives are  93% accurate.  Given the full informed consent here; which do you choose?\nDemand a blood HPV test.  No HPV---No CC.  That simple.  Until you get very old.  Don't fall for the big words.\nHold your ground like I did.  Then tell docs what you think of the miserable pap."", 'What you aren\'t being told:  The ""smear test"" is actually a ""scrape test.""  It\'s 53% accurate.  The ""scrape"" removes the single layer of epithelial we have which protect our cervix from virus etc.  If you have HPV, that scrape allows the virus to become embedded into the more nutritious basement cells which then allow it to eventually turn into cancer.  No doctor can argue with me here.\nHPV can be more accurately detected with the Trovagene urine based HPV test which I\'ve used.  It\'s 93% accurate but was d/c due to lack of interest.  Did you know you had a choice?  \nElsewhere, women can use the Delphi Screener.  This is also done at home, like the Trovagene test is/was.  Look it up.\nInstead here, we have these scrapes and pokes. \nGo check out the metal wired instruments used to ""sample"" tissues inside the endocervical canal....or the cheese grater device used to ""curette"" or scrape out tissues deep up inside the endocervical canal.  This, again, is how HPV gets to deeply invasive and dangerous.\nDid you know that a DC named Leroy Nicholas in Chicago can cure HPV w/o all the burning and cutting that usual gene\'s use?\nAs you watch this...know this too.\nHow many young girls were/are forced to have paps?  And what do we see?  A very young woman will automatically show up as CIN or worse on pap as the cells are ""different.""\nDifferent means that the computer which reads all the slides cannot determine what the hell it\'s looking at.  Yes, a computer with an algorhythm is used to score your slides.  When it cannot score them, the default score is CC or CIN3.  The false positives and false negatives are why this test is bullshit.  But hey, w/o that pap the docs wouldn\'t have a good reason to play with our anterior fornix, our g-spots, our rectums/vaginas (rectovaginal exam) at the same time.\nThey could not say ""we must rule-out your ovulation pain as it could possibly be life threatening.""  Notice how good looking women are receiving exams that go on so long dinner is served afterward?  While older women and the fat or uglies are in and out in 15 seconds?  Yes this is true.  And, fact here again.  Only in skinny young girls w/o children can the ovaries be felt up.  Otherwise the doc is looking for you to feel pain etc.\nAnd the HSG where you get iodine injected into your cervix or water/air?  Cramps like hell on earth.  Ever pour salt on a snail?  That\'s what the iodine solution does to your uterus.  A chemical burn spasm.  The water/air?  Like having a period in reverse all in a few seconds.   Pain few docs ever imagine let alone feel.  Endometrial biopsy is the worst of all...\nGo look at videos here and learn.\nNow, a pregnancy?  Again, they must pap you before, and after claiming it\'s standards of care.  It\'s defensive medicine.  \nYou\'ll come up abnormal.  Why, if they already know your cells will be abnormal, do they insist on this stupidity?  And the diagnosis?  If they already know you\'ll be abnormal, how can they claim you\'re dying of CC?  \nAll BS and lies.', ""Whenever I see one of your vids to study my anatomy, I know I'm going to understand it.
